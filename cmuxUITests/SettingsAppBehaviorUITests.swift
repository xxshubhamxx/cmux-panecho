import XCTest

/// Behavioral XCUITests for the Settings **App** section.
///
/// The App section is a single `SettingsCard` with ~30 rows. Most rows
/// drive runtime behavior that lives inside the main-app / Ghostty
/// terminal / Metal surface (dock badge, pane ring/flash, reorder,
/// iMessage, file drops, etc.) which a freshly launched UI-test app
/// cannot exercise without a runtime seam — those are documented as
/// TIER 2 / TIER 3 below.
///
/// What *is* observable through XCUITest, deterministically and without
/// adding any app seam, is the Settings window's own reaction to a
/// changed setting: several App rows recompute their subtitle text from
/// the stored value, and the "Menu Bar Only" row disables the "Show in
/// Menu Bar" row. Those rows expose stable accessibility identifiers
/// (`SettingsMinimalModeToggle`,
/// `SettingsWorkspaceInheritWorkingDirectoryToggle`,
/// `SettingsMenuBarOnlyToggle`, `CommandPaletteSearchAllSurfacesToggle`).
/// Each test below flips one of those, then asserts the *effect* — the
/// new subtitle string appears / the old one disappears, or the gated
/// control's enabled state flips — not merely that the toggle changed
/// value.
///
/// Subtitle strings are matched against the English `defaultValue`s in
/// `AppSection.swift`; the harness forces `-AppleLanguages (en)` so the
/// labels are stable across machines.
///
/// TIER 2 (needs runtime seam): effect lives in the main-app window /
/// Ghostty / Metal surface or in timing; not observable from a fresh
/// UI-test launch without an app seam this test must not add.
///   - Theme (app.appearance / appearanceMode): repaints the terminal
///     and chrome via the Metal-backed surface; appearance is not a
///     queryable accessibility attribute.
///   - App Icon (app.appIcon / appIconMode): swaps the Dock/app icon
///     image; Dock tile imagery is not an XCUITest accessibility element.
///   - New Workspace Placement (app.newWorkspacePlacement): only
///     observable after creating ≥2 workspaces and inspecting sidebar
///     order; requires workspace scaffolding the fresh UI-test launch
///     does not have (CMUX_UI_TEST_MODE skips session restore).
///   - Keep Workspace Open When Closing Last Surface
///     (closeWorkspaceOnLastSurfaceShortcut): only observable by closing
///     the last surface of a real workspace and checking whether the
///     workspace survives; needs workspace+surface scaffolding.
///   - Focus Pane on First Click (paneFirstClickFocus.enabled): effect is
///     window-activation + pane-focus timing on an inactive window;
///     requires two windows and focus-state inspection of a Ghostty pane.
///   - File Drops (fileDrop.defaultBehavior): effect is on a drag-and-drop
///     gesture over a terminal/editor surface; XCUITest cannot synthesize
///     the file-promise drag this consumes.
///   - Open Supported Files / Open Markdown (openSupportedFilesInCmux,
///     openMarkdownInCmuxViewer): effect triggers on Cmd-click of a file
///     in a terminal surface, opening a preview/markdown window; needs a
///     live terminal with clickable file text.
///   - iMessage Mode (app.iMessageMode): reorders a workspace to top and
///     shows the submitted message when an agent prompt is sent; needs an
///     agent surface and a send action.
///   - Reorder on Notification (workspaceAutoReorderOnNotification): needs
///     ≥2 workspaces and an injected notification to observe reordering.
///   - Dock Badge (notificationDockBadgeEnabled): sets the Dock tile
///     badge label; Dock tile state is not an XCUITest element.
///   - Show in Menu Bar (showMenuBarExtra): adds/removes an NSStatusItem
///     in the system menu bar, which is a separate process surface not in
///     this app's element tree. (Its *disabled* gating by Menu Bar Only is
///     TIER 1 below.)
///   - Unread Pane Ring / Pane Flash (notificationPaneRingEnabled,
///     notificationPaneFlashEnabled): draw a ring/flash overlay on a pane
///     inside the Ghostty/Metal surface on notification; not queryable and
///     needs an injected notification.
///   - Warn Before Quit (confirmQuit/warnBeforeQuitShortcut): effect is a
///     confirmation sheet on Cmd+Q; exercising it would terminate the app
///     under test mid-run.
///   - Warn Before Closing Tab (warnBeforeClosingTabShortcut): effect is a
///     confirmation sheet when closing a real tab; needs a tab to close
///     (the *subtitle* swap would be TIER 1, but this row has no stable
///     accessibility id to flip the toggle deterministically).
///   - Warn Before Tab Close Button (warnBeforeClosingTabXButton): same —
///     confirmation on the tab "X" button; needs a tab and a stable id.
///   - Hide Tab Close Button (hideTabCloseButton): hides the per-tab close
///     "X" in the main window tab strip; needs a workspace tab present and
///     has no stable accessibility id on its Settings toggle to flip.
///   - Rename Selects Existing Name (commandPalette.renameSelectAllOnFocus):
///     effect is whether the Command Palette rename field starts fully
///     selected vs caret-at-end; needs the palette open on a renamable
///     row and selection-range inspection.
///   - Preferred Editor / Notification Sound / Notification Command:
///     out-of-process effects (launch an editor, play a sound, run a shell
///     command); not in-app observable.
///
/// TIER 3 (not e2e): cross-app/external/no in-app UI effect.
///   - Send anonymous telemetry (sendAnonymousTelemetry): gates a network
///     analytics pipeline read only at next launch; no UI effect to assert
///     and nothing should hit the network from a test. Verify via the
///     telemetry client's unit tests instead.
