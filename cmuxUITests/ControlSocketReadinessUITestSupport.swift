    /// Waits for a cmux control socket listener to become ready in two
    /// decoupled phases, then returns whether it answered a `ping` with `PONG`.
    ///
    /// The two phases exist to keep a slow app cold-launch on hosted CI runners
    /// from starving the ping budget:
    ///
    /// 1. **Listener bound.** Wait up to `listenerBindTimeout` for the listener
    ///    to bind, observed as the Unix-domain socket file appearing on disk.
    ///    The server creates that file with `bind(2)` before it accepts, so the
    ///    file appearing is a real readiness signal, not a fixed sleep. Each UI
    ///    test binds a unique per-run socket path and removes it in `setUp`, so
    ///    the file can only appear because *this* app instance bound it.
    /// 2. **Accepting and responsive.** With the listener bound, wait up to
    ///    `pingTimeout` (a *fresh* budget that only starts once phase 1
    ///    completes) for it to accept a connection and answer `ping` with
    ///    `PONG`.
    ///
    /// Splitting the wait this way is the fix for the flake in
    /// https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5414: previously a single
    /// fixed `pingTimeout` had to cover *both* the time for the listener to
    /// bind and the time to answer, so a slow cold-launch could exhaust the
    /// whole budget before the listener even existed. Now a slow launch is
    /// absorbed by `listenerBindTimeout` and the ping confirmation always gets
    /// its full budget.
    ///
    /// Both phases poll their condition on a fixed cadence with a deterministic
    /// deadline loop (``pollControlSocketCondition``), re-evaluating every
    /// ``pollInterval`` until the bound elapses.
    ///
    /// This deliberately does *not* use `XCTNSPredicateExpectation`. That class
    /// is unreliable here because the conditions are non-KVO closures that do
    /// blocking socket I/O: the ping closure opens a connection and blocks up to
    /// its response timeout on every evaluation. `XCTNSPredicateExpectation`
    /// evaluates such a predicate once, then relies on a polling timer scheduled
    /// on the run loop to re-evaluate; under `XCTWaiter.wait` that re-poll can be
    /// starved, so a single early `false` (the listener bound but its accept
    /// loop not yet answering, a sub-second window) makes the waiter sit on the
    /// stale `false` for the full timeout even though the socket became
    /// responsive almost immediately. That is the flake seen in CI on
    /// `BrowserPaneNavigationKeybindUITests` (issue surfaced 2026-06-13): the
    /// app's own sanity check reported `PONG` ~1s after launch, yet the test's
    /// 12s ping wait failed. A plain deadline loop guarantees the ping is
    /// actually retried for the whole budget. See also
    /// https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5414 for the two-phase split.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - listenerBindTimeout: Maximum time to wait for the socket file to
    ///     appear (the listener-bound signal). Generous on purpose so a slow
    ///     launch does not eat the ping budget; only hit on a genuine bind
    ///     failure.
    ///   - pingTimeout: Fresh budget for the `ping` -> `PONG` round trip once
    ///     the listener has bound.
    ///   - pollInterval: How long to wait between condition re-evaluations.
    ///   - socketFileExists: Returns true once the listener's socket file is on
    ///     disk. A closure (not a path) so callers that resolve among several
    ///     candidate paths can report "any candidate exists".
    ///   - pingReturnsPong: Returns true when a `ping` to the listener answered
    ///     `PONG`.
