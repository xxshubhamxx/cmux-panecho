# Writing style

Read this before drafting or revising top-level issue and PR descriptions, RFCs, or progress updates.

This guides prose; engineering, review, and approval requirements still apply.

## Say what changes

Lead with the concrete problem and resulting behavior. Name what a person or API caller can do after the change, then explain the mechanism needed to assess it.

Use familiar words and precise verbs. Write as you'd speak to a technically literate colleague; contractions are welcome. Preserve useful wording when editing instead of imposing a new cadence.

A small fix often needs a paragraph plus validation. Use headings, lists, code, or diagrams when they help readers understand, not to fill a template. Link deeper evidence instead of narrating the investigation. Examples and suggested lengths aren't quotas.

State a material limitation once, beside the claim it qualifies. Cut repeated summaries, coordination history, stock transitions, and inventories of unrelated things left unchanged. End when the point lands.

## Say what the evidence establishes

Say what ran, what passed, and what that proves. Added tests, executed tests, compilation, and live behavior differ; skipped tests don't establish a pass.

Keep the description current when the implementation changes. Include exact commit or build references where they identify the evidence. Keep earlier attempts only when they explain a decision.

Keep measurements tied to what was observed. A faster app-copy step doesn't establish a faster full build.

## Skills and procedural docs

Name the task and when the instructions apply, then show the first useful action.
Use action headings or a small choice table when paths differ. Put commands beside
the result to inspect; keep recovery advice near the step that can fail. Link
longer references at the point they're needed. Finish with the evidence or output
the task should produce. These are editing tools, not required sections for every
skill.

## Before publishing

Read the description as a reviewer who hasn't seen the conversation. Can they understand the change and assess its evidence? Remove anything that repeats an answer they've already received.

Example opening:

> In a checkout, the settings helper rejects valid sidebar keys that the installed helper accepts. Both now use the same schema-backed path list, with a regression that detects drift.
