/// Regression coverage for the shared-ControlMaster readiness gate that fixes the
/// "only ~2 of N sessions mirror on first attach" race
/// (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/6732).
///
/// The bug: ``RemoteTmuxController`` fires the per-session `tmux -CC attach`
/// connections (each `ControlMaster=auto`) in a tight burst. On a cold first
/// attach they all race to *create* the master at the same `ControlPath`; all but
/// one fail with "ControlSocket … already exists, disabling multiplexing", so only
/// one or two sessions mirror. The fix —
/// ``RemoteTmuxSSHTransport/ensureMasterReady()`` — opens the master exactly once (a
/// single connection can't lose the creation race), then confirms with one
/// authoritative `ssh -O check`. The open's exit code is NOT trusted: under
/// `ControlMaster=auto` ssh can fall back to a non-multiplexed direct connection and
/// still exit 0 without a live shared master, so only the `-O check` proves the
/// burst can ride a live master.
///
/// The OpenSSH creation race itself isn't hermetically reproducible (it needs a
/// real multi-session host), so these tests lock in the *mechanism* that prevents
/// it: a fake `ssh` that records its invocations and tracks a master-up sentinel,
/// asserting the gate opens the master once when cold, is idempotent when warm, and
/// — crucially — reports not-ready when the open succeeds but no master is actually
/// up (the non-multiplexed-fallback hole). The single-flight coalescing of
/// concurrent callers is an actor-reentrancy property verified by review rather than
/// a (necessarily timing-dependent) unit test.
