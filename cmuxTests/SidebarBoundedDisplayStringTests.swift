/// The marker `sidebarBoundedDisplayString` appends when it cuts a block.
///
/// Sidebar text is scanned for GitHub references after it is bounded, and the
/// reference parser trims trailing `.` before reading a number. An ASCII `...`
/// marker is therefore invisible to it: a row cut mid-number reads
/// `owner/repo#84...`, parses as `owner/repo#84`, and offers a link to a
/// different issue than the one the author wrote
/// (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/15882). A single `…` is not
/// trimmed, so the same cut fails to parse and stays plain text, which is the
/// outcome a reader can trust.
///
/// The marker is also what every other user-visible truncation in the app
/// already uses, so this is the spelling the sidebar was the last to adopt.
