## herdr agent-detection plugin

cmux includes a userland agent-detection plugin derived from herdr. Its
manifests and adapted detector sources live under
`cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/`.

- **Package license:** MIT AND Apache-2.0
- **Herdr-derived material:** Apache License 2.0
- **Source:** https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr
- **Detector source reference:** commit `7b675f42af35508eab66ac42fe1598628597a893`
- **Pi bundled-launcher correction:** commit `b1ff4582e9688f52ffb943cfa8bee4871ae122e4`
- **Manifest snapshot:** commit `2290257acb2085ce6842ba5c7e3ca50c3ba64f02`
- **Included manifest fixes:** Claude MCP elicitation `f807b697353cfa00aa912c7cde4830e863001cf5`, Claude background-shell state `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`, Codex weak-blocker scope `f457cff4f2648eee85d176f8a41861241d4e8428`, and Copilot background-agent activity `2290257acb2085ce6842ba5c7e3ca50c3ba64f02`
- **License text:** cmux-owned code is covered by
  `cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/LICENSE-MIT`; the
  herdr-derived files use
  `cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/manifests/LICENSE`
- **Latest agent-surface capability audit:** commit `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`. The herdr repository tip checked on 2026-09-02 is `94f6d9c0d9bb9cf9ffae99d8bbfb09e9bf2fc9e0`; commits after the audit pin change client rendering, terminal reads, graphics ownership, Windows input and worktree handling, or sidebar focus, with no further `src/detect` or manifest changes. The audit includes the exact Pi bundled CLI path correction from `b1ff4582e9688f52ffb943cfa8bee4871ae122e4` and the Claude background-shell state correction from `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`, both adapted and tested in the userland package. The first-acquisition OSC retention fix from `82e6a80eb3ae39fb3d3ebd4d1fed19389767e605` is adapted in the userland tracker. The foreground group-leader CWD fix from `3a3792622e59c7f2dc20f9c0236167161e4a5035` is already covered by cmux's generic `foreground_cwd` resource. The shell-render refactor in `207be3c771d281baae6e5fa0fb74be9a056e97a2` and independent multi-client tab views in `6c0bb273d5d5405a00985621b17e36f8b4d64609` are application/client architecture and are not copied. The delayed-agent-prompt fix in `8633a398e653eee47b375c963996c78a8a14aa48` changes PTY input sequencing, and `5616196942cbe752cc0659b9bd0fb616b2a6ed5c` hardens malformed Windows process environments in portable-pty. These changes are outside detector behavior and are not copied. SDK endpoint-generation compatibility remains a standalone-release requirement; review the Windows changes before publishing a Windows package.

Nineteen manifests are unchanged from the manifest snapshot. `claude.toml` is
byte-identical to upstream commit `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`.
`grok.toml` is based on the snapshot file and contains one documented cmux
precedence correction. `github-copilot.toml` is byte-identical to the snapshot
and uses upstream version `2026.08.29.1`. The manifest engine, process discovery, state detector, and update
logic are adapted for the cmux userland plugin contract. The source paths,
commits, license, and adaptations are recorded in
`cmux-tui/bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.
The SHA256SUMS file is a checked-in byte-provenance record verified before the
bundled manifests are compiled. It detects accidental drift, but it is not a
cryptographic release signature for remote updates.
