"""Every guard that reads a workflow must be run by a workflow.

A test under tests/ that opens a file from .github/workflows/ exists to hold
some CI invariant still. If nothing in .github/workflows/ ever executes that
test, the invariant is unenforced and the file is decoration: it keeps passing
locally while main drifts away from what it asserts, and it reports nothing
when the drift breaks a release.

That is not hypothetical here. tests/test_tui_publish_dispatch_budget.py
arrived with the dispatch-budget fix it was written to hold, was never named by
any workflow, and cmux-tui v0.13.0 failed to publish on that exact regression
anyway. tests/test_ci_universal_release_settings.sh kept asserting that
scripts/setup.sh builds GhosttyKit universal for however long it has been since
that build moved to scripts/ensure-ghosttykit.sh -- an assertion about a file
that had stopped doing the job, which nothing was in a position to notice.

So the rule is structural rather than a list of known guards: discover the
guards from what they read, discover the wiring from what the workflows run,
and require the second to cover the first.
