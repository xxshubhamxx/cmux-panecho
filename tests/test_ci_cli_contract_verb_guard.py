"""CI guard for ./scripts/check-cli-contract-verbs.py.

The guarded property: every top-level verb `CMUXCLI.run()` dispatches has a row
in `docs/cli-contract.md`. An agent-reachability audit read that table, found no
`layout` row, and concluded saved layouts were unreachable from the CLI; `cmux
layout` had shipped all along.

The negative cases below are what keep the guard from rotting into a no-op,
because a guard that parses source has five ways to go quiet: an anchor it can
no longer find, a case shape it cannot read, a dispatch route it does not look
at, a comparison whose right side is not a literal, and a brace inside a string
that ends its scan early. It also has two ways to pass for the wrong reason: a
row in a table that documents something other than commands, and a table whose
rows it cannot parse at all.

Cases:
  (a) The real cmux checkout passes.
  (b) A minimal fixture passes, counting both dispatch routes.
  (c) A dispatched verb with no row fails, named with its line number.
  (d) An alias sharing a case arm with a documented verb is checked on its own.
  (e) A verb documented in a family table below the top-level table passes. This
      is the tmux compatibility set, which lives in its own table; reading only
      the top-level section reported 23 verbs as undocumented.
  (f) Renaming `func run()` fails loudly instead of finding no verbs.
  (g) Removing `switch command {` fails the same way.
  (h) An unclosed switch fails instead of running off the end of the file.
  (i) A case pattern that is not a list of string literals fails by name, so a
      new pattern shape cannot silently drop its verbs.
  (j) A comma-separated pattern split over several lines is read as one arm.
  (k) A `:` inside a string literal does not truncate the pattern.
  (l) A switch nested inside the top-level switch does not contribute verbs,
      nor do switches elsewhere in the file.
  (m) A contract with no top-level table heading fails.
  (n) A contract with no command table rows fails.
  (o) An `if command == "…"` early return before the switch is a dispatched
      verb: `cmux diff` and `cmux version` are routed that way, and a guard
      reading only the switch shipped blind to 45 verbs.
  (p) A brace inside a multiline string literal does not end the switch scan, so
      arms below it are still read.
  (q) A verb name inside a comment or a string is not a dispatched verb.
  (r) A row in a table that is not a command table does not document a verb. The
      `sessions` field of `cmux sessions --json` must not vouch for a verb.
  (s) A switch whose brace count ends somewhere that is not the close of a
      switch fails, instead of silently dropping every arm below it.
  (t) `command == SomeType.someConstant` is a dispatched verb, resolved by
      reading the `static let` in the file declaring that type. Four hidden
      verbs reached main this way while the guard read only literals.
  (u) The same shape with no row fails, named at the constant's own line, which
      is where someone has to look to learn the verb's spelling.
  (v) A `command ==` whose right side is neither a literal nor a resolvable
      constant fails by line instead of being skipped.
  (w) `SomeType(command: command, …)` is a dispatch route: an initializer that
      returns nil for a verb it does not own. Its verbs are read from the file
      declaring the type, by comparison and by its own `switch command`.
  (x) An initializer route whose type declaration cannot be found fails.
  (y) An initializer route whose type names no readable verb fails, rather than
      contributing nothing and passing.
  (z) A lowercase helper taking the same `command:` argument label is a
      predicate, not a route, and demands nothing.
 (aa) A compactly written table (`|Command|Contract|`) counts, and an escaped
      pipe inside a first cell does not cut the row's verb off mid-backtick.
 (ab) A constant route whose named constant is not a readable string in the
      type's file fails, because a renamed constant is a lost verb.
 (ac) Spacing around `==` does not hide a route. `command  ==  "x"` and
      `command=="x"` are both dispatch, and a guard that read only the
      single-space spelling skipped them while still reporting success.
 (ad) A qualified receiver (`entry.command == "…"`) is not a route.
 (ae) An initializer route wrapped over several lines is still a route. Read
      one line at a time, a reformat silently dropped the verbs it owns.
 (af) A second `switch command {` in `run()` contributes its verbs, instead of
      the guard reading the first switch and calling it a day.
 (ag) An arm indented deeper than its siblings (inside a `#if`) is still an arm.
 (ah) A constant declared with a type annotation resolves.
 (ai) Two files declaring the same type with different constants fails, rather
      than one of them quietly winning.
 (aj) A comparison the guard cannot read inside an initializer route's own type
      fails, the same as one at the dispatch.
 (ak) A type whose name merely contains the route's type name does not stand in
      for it.
 (al) `command == Self.someConstant` fails with a message that says why, since
      no file declares `Self`.
 (am) An unrelated type in the route type's file is not part of the route, so
      its own `command ==` comparison neither adds a verb nor fails the guard.
