"""A required check must be bounded, and a superseded PR run must be cancelled.

Two properties, both of which CI is structurally unable to complain about
because neither one makes anything fail.

A job with no `timeout-minutes` inherits GitHub's six-hour default. Every job
in `ci.yml` declares one between 5 and 20 minutes except `ci-status`, which is
the required aggregate: the check every pull request in the repository is
blocked on. A hang there blocks the whole repository for six hours and reads
as "still running" the entire time.

A `pull_request` workflow with no concurrency group starts a fresh run per
push and lets the superseded ones finish. `ci.yml` and most of its neighbours
already cancel; five path-filtered workflows had no group at all.

Both rules stay derived rather than listed. The required contexts come from
the repository ruleset and are matched to jobs by name, and a context that
stops matching any job fails this test rather than quietly guarding nothing.
