"""Unset repository variables must select the cheap path, not the expensive one.

Fork pull requests receive no repository variables, so every `vars.X` a
workflow reads can arrive empty. #13717 found CI silently running the full
macOS suite and missing every cache restore because three expressions had no
literal fallback. That fix edited the sites it found; nothing stopped the next
copy of the same expression from landing without one, and several did.

Two rules, both checked against the workflows themselves rather than a list of
known-good sites:

1. A `runs-on:` that reads a repository variable needs a literal runner label
   to fall back to. An empty `runs-on:` cannot schedule at all.
2. A variable that selects how much work to do, or where a cache lives, needs
   the repository's own value written next to it as a literal. The table below
   is the one hand-maintained part, and it names three variables, not the
   dozens of sites that read them.
