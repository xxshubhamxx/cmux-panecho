"""Every cmux.json path a settings row advertises must appear in the declared
supported-path set.

`CmuxSettingsFileStore+SupportedPaths.swift` says of its set: "Settings UI rows
validate against this set so new persisted settings need an explicit cmux.json
review." Nothing enforced that, so a row could advertise a path absent from the
set and nobody noticed.

Be precise about what this proves. `supportedSettingsJSONPaths` has **no
production consumer** -- it is read by this guard and one test, and by nothing
that parses cmux.json. What actually accepts a key is the hand-written section
parsers in `KeyboardShortcutSettingsFileStore.swift` and
`CmuxSettingsFileStore+AppSection.swift`. So this is a consistency check between
two declarations (the UI row and the documented set), not proof that writing the
key does anything.

The gap is real in both directions. `canvas.paneGap` and
`canvas.snappingEnabled` are advertised by rows, are listed in the supported
set, and therefore pass this guard -- yet `root["canvas"]` is never read by any
parser, so writing them does nothing. Catching that class needs an oracle
derived from the parsers; see the tracking issue. Until then, a pass here means
"the row and the documented set agree", nothing stronger.
