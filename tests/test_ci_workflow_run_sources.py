"""A `workflow_run` trigger spells a display name; pin it to the file behind it.

`on.workflow_run.workflows:` matches the triggering workflow's `name:`. That
name is presentation text. Renaming a workflow for clarity stops every consumer
of it from triggering, and nothing turns red: the consumer simply never runs
again. `merge-group-fail-fast.yml` is the expensive version of that failure --
it cancels a merge group's CI run at the first failed job, so when it stops
firing every queue entry behind a doomed one burns full runner time instead.

The Actions API does carry stable identity. A workflow run object has `path`
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and `workflow_id` next to the presentation `name`,
and a run can be located by file path through
`repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows/<file>/runs`. The trigger filter accepts
neither, so the name has to stay in the trigger. What changes is that the name
stops being the only copy: each consumer declares the file it means in
`env.SOURCE_WORKFLOW_PATHS`, and this test derives the expected names from
those files. Renaming a producer now fails this test on the pull request that
renames it.

Matching a *job* by display name has no stable alternative at all: the jobs API
reports `name` and never the YAML job id. Those matches are listed below so the
same derivation applies to them. The one in `update-homebrew.yml` is already
pinned by `tests/test_release_homebrew_gate.py` and is not repeated here.
