/// window, so a single cmux tab can render the tmux window's full multi-pane
/// split layout side by side — with the native cmux pane chrome (each pane is a
/// real ``TerminalPanel`` rendered via ``TerminalPanelView``).
///
/// Created by ``RemoteTmuxSessionMirror`` from a window's first published layout;
/// it owns every pane's panel as that window later splits or rejoins. The
/// remote tmux control stream is the source of truth: pane output is fed into
/// the matching surface, typed input is forwarded to that pane via `send-keys`,
/// and a user split is propagated to `split-window`.
///
/// SIZING IS FEED-FORWARD. The size pushed to tmux (``updateClientSize()``) is
/// a pure function of the container's pixel size, the BASE layout tree's
/// STRUCTURE, and measured render constants — never of tmux-assigned geometry
/// or rendered grids. The render side sets bonsplit divider fractions from
/// tmux's assigned cells (``RemoteTmuxNativeSplitLayoutPlanner`` via
/// ``imposeDividerPlan()``, driven by the sizing pass). Neither
/// direction measures the other back,
/// so tmux's `%layout-change` echo of our own push recomputes to the identical
/// size and dedups to silence: there is no feedback loop to gate, budget, or
/// pin against. Pane ratios are user state and are never written.
