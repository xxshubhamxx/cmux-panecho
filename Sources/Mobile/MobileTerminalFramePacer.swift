/// Bounds how often one terminal surface's render-grid frames are emitted to
/// paired phones.
///
/// Ungoverned, the mobile emission path captures a frame on every Ghostty
/// tick, so an animating TUI (a coding agent's spinner and streaming repaint)
/// ships ~27 frames/second — ~100KB/s over a relay — and a user's keystroke
/// echo queues behind that firehose. Text carries no information above
/// ~10 changes/second, so the pacer coalesces sustained repaints down to a
/// dynamic per-surface rate while keeping two invariants:
///
/// - **Echo bypass**: a frame that would carry a newer accepted-input marker
///   than the last emitted frame is never delayed. Pacing exists to protect
///   keystroke echoes; it must not tax them.
/// - **Chain safety**: pacing gates *capture*, not emission of already-diffed
///   frames. Each emitted delta still diffs against the previous emitted
///   frame, so the render-grid revision chain stays gapless and never
///   triggers the stale/replay machinery.
///
/// The period is dynamic per surface: it starts and stays at the floor
/// (90ms, ~11fps) while the transport keeps up, widens multiplicatively each
/// time the bounded per-connection queues shed (the transport's existing
/// backpressure signal, surfaced as a full-resync request), and decays back
/// toward the floor after a quiet interval. Pure state machine: the owner
/// supplies timestamps and schedules the deferred flush it is told to.
