/// What Cloud work this app may start on its own, decided from local state.
///
/// The Cloud subsystems that would otherwise start at launch ask here first:
/// the cmux-tui registry's fleet polling, and the app-managed tunnel (the
/// system Network Extension). A Mac that never turned on
/// `Settings › Beta Features › Cloud Machines` and never had a machine answers
/// "no" to all of it without a control-plane request and without touching
/// NetworkExtension. Nothing here probes NetworkExtension to decide whether
/// NetworkExtension may be used.
///
/// Two different facts are kept apart. "This Mac has used Cloud" (the cached
/// marker, or a tunnel role enrolled on this Mac) preserves prior-use context. "The account has a machine right now" is
/// only ever the cached marker, which every fleet list refills, sign-out
/// clears, and a delete resets to unknown; launch-time decisions and status
/// treat anything but a known machine as "no", while an explicit Cloud use
/// (browser open, `cmux vpn up`) settles the count against the control plane
/// through `resolveCloudMachine` before a start is scheduled, whatever the
/// marker says: a machine deleted or created outside this app must not be
/// trusted or missed on the strength of the last poll.
///
/// The inputs are injected closures so the decision is testable without a
/// signed bundle; ``live(defaults:machineCache:browserTunnel:terminalTunnel:resolveCloudMachine:)``
/// wires the Beta Features toggle (plus the managed `DisableCloud` policy),
/// the cached machine count and this Mac's tunnel enrollment files, the
/// browser-role VPN configuration on disk, and ``VMClient`` for resolution.
