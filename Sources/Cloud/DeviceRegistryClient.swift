/// Mac's current routes on reload and auto-pair instead of re-scanning a QR.
///
/// Event-driven: it observes ``MobileHostService/statusUpdates()`` and registers
/// whenever the advertised route set changes (e.g. the Mac moved networks or
/// rebound to a different port), which is exactly the freshness the phone needs.
/// Gating falls out of the routes: ``MobileHostService`` advertises no routes
/// until the user has enabled mobile pairing, so an empty route set is never
/// registered. There is no separate opt-in flag — the registry is core to the
/// pairing the user already turned on, not a distinct privacy surface.
///
/// Best-effort and non-blocking, mirroring ``PhonePushClient``: a registry
/// outage never disturbs the Mac, and pairing still works through the phone's
/// locally stored routes.
