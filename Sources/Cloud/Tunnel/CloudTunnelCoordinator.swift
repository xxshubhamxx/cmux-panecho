/// Owns *when* this Mac's WireGuard tunnel into the Cloud VM network runs, on
/// builds where the app manages it (``CloudTunnelBackend/networkExtension``).
///
/// The policy, in one place:
///
/// - **Off until asked for explicitly.** Terminals, Ports, and Desktop reach
///   machines through ``CloudWireGuardHub`` and never start this tunnel, so
///   nothing the app opens can trigger the one-time extension approval. The
///   system-wide route exists for `cmux vpn up` (other apps on this Mac,
///   `.internal` hostnames) and for a caller that asks through
///   ``requirePrivateNetworkUse(_:)``; a start that needs approval reports
///   `.awaitingApproval`, which the Machines panel shows with a link to
///   System Settings.
/// - **Idle stop.** While up and unpinned, an idle timer restarts on every use.
///   When it fires and no consumer is live (``CloudTunnelConsumerSource``),
///   the tunnel stops. `cmux vpn up` pins it until `cmux vpn down`.
/// - **Stops with the session.** Sign-out, revoke, and app termination stop it.
/// - **Off until admitted.** Every start path awaits ``CloudTunnelAdmission``
///   first (``CloudActivationPolicy`` in production: Cloud Machines on, and
///   the account has a machine, resolved through the control plane when local
///   state cannot say). A refused start touches neither enrollment nor
///   NetworkExtension; `down`, sign-out, quit, and `revoke` stay available so
///   a tunnel from an earlier opted-in session is still cleaned up.
/// - macOS never auto-connects it: no NetworkExtension on-demand rules are set.
///
/// An unavailable backend fails closed for these callers. It does not run a
/// command-line fallback.
