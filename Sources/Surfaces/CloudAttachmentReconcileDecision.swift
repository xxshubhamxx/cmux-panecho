/// for panes whose byte stream is perfectly healthy. Fencing those tore down
/// working terminals for no visible reason. A stream that is actually dead
/// reports itself (`.transportClosed`, a liveness timeout); the pass only needs
/// to act on sessions that are not attached, on a changed numeric id, or on a
