    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - onPaneOutput: receives every `%output` (raw, octal-unescaped bytes).
    ///   - onPaneSeed: receives an authoritative snapshot and its ordered live cutover.
    ///   - onPaneCwd: receives a pane's working directory (`pane_current_path`),
    ///     both the initial value and live changes (see ``requestPanePath(paneId:)``
    ///     and ``subscribePanePath(paneId:)``).
    ///   - onPaneReflow: receives a pane's reflow classification (`true` = suppress
    ///     reflow on resize for alt-screen / inline-TUI panes like claude; `false`
    ///     = a plain shell whose primary-screen scrollback may reflow), both the
    ///     initial value and live changes (see ``subscribePaneReflow(paneId:)``).
    ///   - onActivePaneChanged: fires when a window's active pane changes
    ///     (`%window-pane-changed`), so consumers can re-project per-pane state
    ///     (e.g. the active pane's directory) onto the window's tab.
    ///   - onSessionChanged: fires when tmux confirms a session name change via
    ///     `%session-changed` or `%session-renamed`.
    ///   - onTopologyChanged: fires when the window/pane topology changes.
    ///   - onReconnectReady: fires after reconnect attach drainage and reseeding,
    ///     when observers may safely schedule commands against fresh topology.
    ///   - onExit: fires once when the connection PERMANENTLY ends (a genuine tmux
    ///     `%exit`, or a session found gone on reconnect). A transient transport loss
    ///     does NOT fire this — the connection reconnects instead.
    ///   - onConnectionStateChanged: fires on every ``ConnectionState`` transition
    ///     (e.g. `.connected` → `.reconnecting` on a transport loss), so consumers
    ///     can show a disconnected/reconnecting indicator without tearing down.
