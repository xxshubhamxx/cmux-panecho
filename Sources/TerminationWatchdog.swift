/// Hard deadline on AppKit's application-termination sequence.

/// `-[NSApplication terminate:]` synchronously posts `NSApplicationWillTerminate`
/// and drives a gauntlet of observers — several of them Apple's own and outside
/// our control. One is `CFPasteboardResolveAllPromisedData`, which flushes
/// promised (lazy) pasteboard data with a blocking mach round-trip to the
/// pasteboard server. When a clipboard-history manager (Paste, Raycast, Maccy,
/// Pastebot, …) is mid-read of cmux's promised clipboard data, that round-trip
/// can wedge for ~30s on the main thread until the OS force-kills the app
/// (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/6758). The same structural gap —
/// quit having no global "return within N seconds no matter what" guard —
/// produced #6415 (`PostHogAnalytics.flush()`) and #6381 (`ghostty` lock).
///
/// This watchdog closes that gap. It runs on a dedicated background thread with
/// no run-loop, GCD-queue, or main-actor dependency, so it fires even while the
/// main thread is parked in `mach_msg`. Arm it the instant the app commits to
/// quitting; if the process has not exited within `deadline`, it force-exits,
/// turning a multi-second hang into a bounded quit. The firing path is
/// deliberately unconditional and lock-free — it does no Foundation/filesystem
/// work before exiting, because the termination it guards against may itself be
/// wedged on exactly such a lock. cmux's critical session/state save runs
/// synchronously *before* the watchdog is armed, so the bytes that matter are
/// already on disk if the deadline ever fires.
///
/// Not a singleton: the app's lifecycle owner (`AppDelegate`) holds the
/// instance, alongside its other terminate-control state.
