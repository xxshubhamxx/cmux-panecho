/// Synchronously waits for the callback delivered by `start`, up to `timeout`
/// seconds, returning `nil` on timeout. The shared blocking-wait primitive for
/// control-socket command handlers that bridge an async callback (WKWebView
/// JavaScript results, screenshot capture, cookie-store reads) into a
/// synchronous socket reply.
///
/// This MUST run off the main thread. The control-command execution policy
/// (`ControlCommandExecutionPolicy`) routes every callback-waiting command onto
/// the socket-worker thread for exactly this reason. Parking the **main thread**
/// here freezes the whole app — the sidebar plus every other CLI client
/// serialize behind it — for the full command timeout, which was the #5830
/// whole-app freeze (a `browser eval`/`screenshot` callback waited on inside a
/// nested `CFRunLoopRun()` on the main thread).
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for the callback before giving up.
///   - isMainThread: Whether the calling thread is the main thread. Injected so
///     the main-thread dispatch contract can be exercised deterministically in
///     tests; defaults to the live `Thread.isMainThread`.
///   - start: Begins the async work, invoking the supplied escaping completion
///     with the result when it finishes.
