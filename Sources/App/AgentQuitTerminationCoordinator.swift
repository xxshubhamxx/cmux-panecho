/// The signal path is the hibernation teardown's: exact PID-generation, process
/// group, controlling-TTY, and cmux-scope validation before SIGTERM, then a
/// bounded wait, validated SIGKILL escalation for survivors, and a bounded
/// post-kill wait. If the refresh cannot prove the target group, the process is
/// left alone rather than signaling stale process-group data.
