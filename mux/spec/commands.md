# Command Contract

This file specifies the JSON command contract for the cmux-mux protocol. Implemented commands match protocol v5 in `mux/crates/mux-core/src/server.rs`. Proposed commands are future protocol v6 design.

## Notation

Schema notation is compact and machine-oriented:

| Notation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `uint64` | Non-negative integer fitting a Rust `u64` |
| `uint32` | Non-negative integer fitting a Rust `u32` |
| `uint16` | Non-negative integer fitting a Rust `u16` |
| `usize` | Non-negative integer fitting a Rust `usize` |
| `isize` | Signed integer fitting a Rust `isize` |
| `float32` | JSON number read as Rust `f32` |
| `string`, `boolean`, `null` | JSON primitive |
| `T?` | Field may be absent or null unless the command says otherwise |
| `array<T>` | JSON array |
| `object{a:T,b?:U}` | JSON object with required `a` and optional `b` |
| `Base64` | Standard base64 string |
| `ColorHex` | `#rrggbb`, exactly 7 bytes, ASCII hex |
| `Id` | Implemented numeric id, `uint64` |
| `IdRef` | Proposed id reference, `Id` or short id string |

The canonical request and response envelope is defined in `transports.md`. Command blocks in this file define the command-specific request fields and response `data` shape.

Malformed JSON, unknown command names, missing required fields, and wrong JSON types fail during request decoding with the transport-level `bad request: ...` envelope.

The v5 server does not explicitly deny unknown JSON fields. Clients must not depend on unknown fields being rejected.

Common CLI exit codes for every mapping are `0` success, `1` command error, `2` CLI usage error, and `3` connection error.

## Shared Implemented Result Types

`Tree`:

```text
object{
  workspaces: array<object{
    id: Id,
    name: string,
    active: boolean,
    screens: array<object{
      id: Id,
      name: string|null,
      active: boolean,
      active_pane: Id,
      zoomed_pane: Id|null,
      layout: Layout,
      panes: array<Pane>
    }>
  }>
}
```

`Layout`:

```text
object{type:"leaf",pane:Id}
| object{type:"split",dir:"right"|"down",ratio:float32,a:Layout,b:Layout}
```

`DeclarativeLayout`:

```text
object{type:"leaf",cwd?:string,command?:array<string>}
| object{type:"split",dir:"right"|"down",ratio:float32,a:DeclarativeLayout,b:DeclarativeLayout}
```

`Pane`:

```text
object{id:Id,name:string|null,active_tab:usize,tabs:array<Tab>}
| object{id:Id,dead:true}
```

`Tab`:

```text
object{
  surface: Id,
  kind: "pty"|"browser",
  browser_source: "external"|"launched"|null,
  name: string|null,
  title: string,
  size: object{cols:uint16,rows:uint16}|null,
  dead: boolean
}
```

The `dead` pane variant is serialized by the v5 server only if the tree references a pane missing from state. That should not occur in normal operation, but clients must tolerate it.

## Implemented Commands

### identify

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

```

### export-layout

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `export-layout` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Returns one screen's canonical split tree and the surface ids attached to each leaf pane. Zoom state does not rewrite the exported tree.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `screen` | `Id` | default active screen | Must identify a screen |

Result:

```text
object{layout:Layout,panes:array<object{pane:Id,surfaces:array<Id>}>}
```

CLI mapping: verb `export-layout`; flags `[--screen <id>]`; plain stdout and JSON stdout both print the exact result object.

### apply-layout

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `apply-layout` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Creates a new screen in the given or active workspace from a declarative split tree. Each leaf creates a new pane with one PTY surface. `command` is argv (`array<string>`), not a shell string. Ratios use the same clamp path as `set-ratio`.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspace` | `Id` | default active workspace | Existing workspace; if omitted and none exists, one is created |
| `name` | `string` | default null | New screen name |
| `layout` | `DeclarativeLayout` | required | Must contain at least one leaf |

Result:

```text
object{screen:Id,panes:array<object{pane:Id,surface:Id}>}
```

Errors: `unknown workspace <id>`, `layout must contain at least one leaf`, `leaf command must not be empty`, spawn or PTY error string, `bad request: ...`.

CLI mapping: verb `apply-layout`; flags `[--workspace <id>] [--name <name>] --layout <json>`; plain stdout prints the new screen and created pane/surface pairs; JSON stdout prints the exact result object.

### send

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `send` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Writes input to a PTY surface. `text`, when present, is UTF-8 encoded and written as bytes. `bytes`, when present, is standard base64 decoded and written as raw bytes. If both are present, v5 writes `text` first and `bytes` second. If neither is present, v5 returns success and writes nothing.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `Id` | required | Must identify a live PTY surface |
| `text` | `string` | default null | Written before `bytes` when both are present |

```text
object{}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `send` |
| Flags | `--surface <id> [--text <text>] [--bytes <base64>]` |
| Plain stdout | no output |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

When neither `--text` nor `--bytes` is supplied, the CLI reads stdin as text and sends it as `text`.

Example:

```json
{"id":3,"cmd":"send","surface":1,"text":"ls\r"}
{"id":3,"ok":true,"data":{}}
```

### read-screen

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `Id` | required | Must identify a live PTY surface |

Result:

```text
object{text:string}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Surface id does not exist |
| `browser surface does not support PTY/VT socket commands` | Surface is a browser |

### vt-state

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `vt-state` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Returns a one-shot base64 VT replay for a PTY surface, including the current screen, styles, cursor, modes, palette, keyboard protocol state, charsets, and tabstops. Replaying this data into a fresh Ghostty VT terminal reproduces the surface state at the time of the snapshot.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `Id` | required | Must identify a live PTY surface |

Result:

```text
object{cols:uint16,rows:uint16,data:Base64}
```

Errors:

```

### new-tab

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `new-tab` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Creates a new PTY tab in a pane and makes it the active tab. If `pane` is absent, the active pane of the active screen is used. If the session has no workspaces and no pane is supplied, v5 creates a new workspace containing the tab. In that empty-session fallback, a supplied `cwd` is silently dropped because v5 delegates to `new_workspace(None, size)`. The new tab inherits the active surface working directory of the target pane when `cwd` is absent.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pane` | `Id` | default null | Target pane; unknown ids error |
| `cwd` | `string` | default null | PTY child working directory |
| `cols` | `uint16` | default null | Used only when paired with `rows` |
| `rows` | `uint16` | default null | Used only when paired with `cols` |

If only one of `cols` or `rows` is present, v5 ignores both because the server uses `cols.zip(rows)`.

Result:

```text
object{surface:Id}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown pane <id>` | Supplied pane id does not exist |
| `pane disappeared while creating tab` | Target pane vanished after validation |
| spawn or PTY error string | PTY creation or child spawn fails |
| `bad request: ...` | Wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `new-tab` |
| Flags | `[--pane <id>] [--cwd <path>] [--cols <n> --rows <n>]` |
| Plain stdout | new surface id followed by newline |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

Example:

```json
{"id":6,"cmd":"new-tab","pane":2,"cwd":"/tmp","cols":100,"rows":30}
{"id":6,"ok":true,"data":{"surface":5}}
```

### new-browser-tab

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `new-browser-tab` |
| status | implemented |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `set-default-colors` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Updates the session default foreground and/or background colors used by PTY surfaces. Missing fields preserve their previous values. Existing PTY surfaces receive the merged defaults. The v5 server emits `surface-output` for every existing surface, including browser surfaces; browser color application is a no-op, but the event is still emitted. Future PTY surfaces start with the merged defaults.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fg` | `ColorHex` | default null | Foreground color |
| `bg` | `ColorHex` | default null | Background color |

### select-tab

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `select-tab` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Selects a tab within a pane by zero-based `index` or relative `delta`. If both `index` and `delta` are present, v5 uses `index` and ignores `delta`. If `pane` is absent, the active pane is used.

No-op event behavior is split by target resolution. If the target pane cannot be resolved, or if the resolved pane has no tabs, v5 returns success and emits no `tree-changed`. This includes an unknown supplied pane, no supplied pane with no active pane, and an empty pane. If the target pane resolves and has tabs, an out-of-range `index` or missing `index`/`delta` returns success and emits `tree-changed` even though the active tab does not change.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pane` | `Id` | default null | Target pane or active pane |
| `index` | `usize` | default null | Zero-based; ignored if out of range |
| `delta` | `isize` | default null | Relative; wraps with Euclidean modulo |

Result:

```text

{"id":23,"ok":true,"data":{}}
```

### select-screen

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `select-screen` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Selects a screen in the active workspace by zero-based `index` or relative `delta`. If both `index` and `delta` are present, v5 uses `index` and ignores `delta`.

No-op event behavior is split by target resolution. If there is no active workspace or the active workspace has no screens, v5 returns success and emits no `tree-changed`. If the active workspace resolves and has screens, an out-of-range `index` or missing `index`/`delta` returns success and emits `tree-changed` even though the active screen does not change.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | `usize` | default null | Zero-based; ignored if out of range |

### select-workspace

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `select-workspace` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Selects a workspace by zero-based `index` or relative `delta`. If both `index` and `delta` are present, v5 uses `index` and ignores `delta`.

No-op event behavior is split by target resolution. If the session has no workspaces, v5 returns success and emits no `tree-changed`. If at least one workspace exists, an out-of-range `index` or missing `index`/`delta` returns success and emits `tree-changed` even though the active workspace does not change.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | `usize` | default null | Zero-based; ignored if out of range |
| `delta` | `isize` | default null | Relative; wraps with Euclidean modulo |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `move-tab` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Moves an existing tab, identified by `surface`, into `pane` at zero-based `index`. Moving a tab to its current pane and current index is an `ok:true` no-op. This command is documented from the consumer-side landed contract; it is not present in this branch's `server.rs`, so out-of-range index behavior and event emission could not be verified here.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `Id` | required | Surface tab to move |
| `pane` | `Id` | required | Destination pane |

### subscribe

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `subscribe` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Subscribes the connection to mux events. After this command, response lines and event lines may be interleaved on the same connection. `subscribe` does not send an initial tree snapshot; clients should call `list-workspaces` when they need state.

Params: none.

Result:

```text
object{}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |

```

### attach-surface

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `attach-surface` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 5 |

Attaches the connection to a PTY surface stream. In protocol v5, the server first sends a `vt-state` event for the current surface state, then sends live `output` events for subsequent PTY bytes, and finally sends `detached` when the stream ends. The command response is sent after the initial `vt-state` event in v5.

Protocol v6 changes the attach stream ordering to `vt-state -> (resized | output)* -> detached`. A v6 `resized` attach event carries a fresh replay and requires clients to discard the old mirror and replace it from that replay. Clients that support only protocol 5 or older must refuse protocol v6 attach streams rather than treating `resized` as a normal resize. The v6 field name `replay` could not be verified against this branch's code.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `Id` | required | Must identify a live PTY surface |

Result:

```text
object{}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Surface id does not exist |
| `browser panes are not supported over attach yet` | Surface is a browser |
| terminal error string | VT replay generation fails |

| `bad request: ...` | Missing `surface` or wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `attach-surface` |
| Flags | `--surface <id>` |
| Plain stdout | JSON event object per line |

## Proposed Commands

### wait-for

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `wait-for` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Blocks until a regular expression matches the current plain-text screen for a PTY surface. The server polls the same text source as `read-screen` and returns as soon as a match is found or the timeout expires. This is the primary automation synchronization primitive.

Params:

```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Surface id does not exist |

```

### run

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `run` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Spawns a command in a new PTY tab and returns the new surface id. `argv` executes directly without a shell. `command` executes through the session shell as `shell -lc <command>`. Exactly one of `argv` or `command` is required. By default the tab is created in the active pane. With `pane`, it is created in that pane. With `new_workspace:true`, a new workspace is created instead.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `argv` | `array<string>` | required if `command` absent | Non-empty; direct exec |
| `command` | `string` | required if `argv` absent | Executed via shell `-lc` |

| `cols` | `uint16` | default null | Used only with `rows` |
| `rows` | `uint16` | default null | Used only with `cols` |

Result:

```text
object{surface:Id,pane:Id,screen:Id,workspace:Id}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `argv or command is required` | Neither is supplied |

```

### send-key

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `send-key` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Sends named key chords to a surface without requiring callers to hand-encode escape sequences. PTY surfaces use the same Ghostty key encoder as the TUI, synced to the surface terminal modes. Browser surfaces translate supported keys to CDP keyboard input when the browser runtime is local.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `IdRef` | required | Target surface |
| `keys` | `array<string>` | required | Non-empty key chord list |

Supported names are `enter`, `tab`, `backtab`, `escape`, `backspace`, `delete`, `insert`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `f1` through `f24`, printable single characters, `ctrl+<key>`, `alt+<key>`, and `shift+<key>` where the encoder supports it.

Result:

```text
object{}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Surface id does not exist |
| `unknown key <key>` | Key token is not supported |

| `browser surface does not support PTY/VT socket commands` | Surface is a browser |
| `bad mode <mode>` | Mode is not allowed |
| `no selection` | Mode is `selection` and no selection exists |
| `scrollback unavailable` | Mode is `scrollback` and the terminal cannot export it |
| `bad request: ...` | Missing fields or wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `copy` |
| Flags | `--surface <id> --mode screen|selection|scrollback` |
| Plain stdout | extracted text exactly |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

Example:

```json
{"id":104,"cmd":"copy","surface":1,"mode":"screen"}
{"id":104,"ok":true,"data":{"text":"ready> ","mode":"screen"}}
```

### ids

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `ids` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Returns the session id mapping. Every workspace, screen, pane, and surface has a numeric id and a stable short id for the lifetime of the session. Short ids are content-independent and collision-checked per session. Accepting short ids anywhere an `IdRef` is accepted remains proposed; implemented command parameters currently accept numeric ids only.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `string` | default null | Optional filter: `"workspace"`, `"screen"`, `"pane"`, or `"surface"` |

Short id format:

```text
[a-z0-9]{6}
```

Generation rule: implemented short ids are stable six-character base36 ids collision-checked across live ids. The proposed future scheme derives a candidate from a per-session random seed plus numeric id, encodes it base36, and checks for collisions across all live ids. On collision, it rehashes with an incrementing salt. Short ids never depend on names, titles, command text, cwd, or layout position.

Resolution rule: short-id / `IdRef` string resolution across commands is still proposed and not yet accepted by the implementation. Implemented commands currently deserialize id parameters as numeric JSON ids. Proposed behavior is: numeric JSON ids resolve first; string ids matching `[0-9]+` are rejected as ambiguous; string ids matching the short-id format resolve by exact short id; unknown or ambiguous strings error.

Result:

```text
object{ids:array<object{kind:"workspace"|"screen"|"pane"|"surface",id:Id,short_id:string}>}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `bad kind <kind>` | Filter kind is not allowed |
| `bad request: ...` | Wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `ids` |
| Flags | `[--kind workspace|screen|pane|surface]` |
| Plain stdout | one line per id: `<kind> <id> <short_id>` |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |

Example:

```json
{"id":105,"cmd":"ids","kind":"surface"}
{"id":105,"ok":true,"data":{"ids":[{"kind":"surface","id":1,"short_id":"a8f3k2"}]}}
```

### notify

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `notify` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Posts a notification into the mux notification area. This is a telemetry command and must not change app focus or pane selection.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` | required | Non-empty |
| `body` | `string` | required | May be empty |
| `level` | `string` | default `"info"` | `"info"`, `"warning"`, or `"error"` |
| `surface` | `IdRef` | default null | Optional originating surface |

Result:

```text
object{notification:Id}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `title is required` | Title is empty |
| `bad level <level>` | Level is not allowed |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Optional surface id does not exist |
| `bad request: ...` | Missing fields or wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `notify` |
| Flags | `--title <title> --body <body> [--level info|warning|error] [--surface <id>]` |
| Plain stdout | notification id followed by newline |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

Example:

```json
{"id":106,"cmd":"notify","title":"Build failed","body":"api tests failed","level":"error","surface":1}
{"id":106,"ok":true,"data":{"notification":44}}
```

### list-agents

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `list-agents` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Returns known agent status records. Records may come from detection, explicit reports, or hooks. Explicit hook-authority reports override detection for the same surface until another explicit report changes the state or the surface closes.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `IdRef` | default null | Optional surface filter |
| `state` | `string` | default null | Optional state filter |

Result:

```text
object{
  agents: array<object{
    surface: Id,
    state: "working"|"blocked"|"idle"|"done"|"unknown",
    source: "detected"|"socket"|"hook",
    session: string|null,
    updated_at_ms: uint64
  }>
}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Optional surface id does not exist |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `list-agents` |
| Flags | `[--surface <id>] [--state working|blocked|idle|done|unknown]` |
| Plain stdout | one line per agent: `<surface> <state> <source> <session-or->` |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

Example:

```json
{"id":107,"cmd":"list-agents","state":"blocked"}
{"id":107,"ok":true,"data":{"agents":[{"surface":1,"state":"blocked","source":"hook","session":"abc","updated_at_ms":1710000000000}]}}
```

### report-agent

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `report-agent` |
| status | implemented |
| since | protocol 6 |

Reports agent state for a surface. This is a telemetry command and must not change focus. Reports with `source:"hook"` have hook authority and override detector-derived state. Reports with `source:"socket"` override detector-derived state but are lower priority than a newer hook report.

Params:

| Name | JSON type | Required/default | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` | `IdRef` | required | Surface associated with the agent |
| `state` | `string` | required | `"working"`, `"blocked"`, `"idle"`, `"done"`, or `"unknown"` |
| `source` | `string` | required | `"socket"` or `"hook"` |
| `session` | `string` | default null | Optional upstream agent session id |

Result:

```text
object{surface:Id,state:string,source:string,session:string|null}
```

Errors:

| Error | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown surface <id>` | Surface id does not exist |
| `bad state <state>` | State is not allowed |
| `bad source <source>` | Source is not allowed |
| `bad request: ...` | Missing fields or wrong JSON type |

CLI mapping:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Verb | `report-agent` |
| Flags | `--surface <id> --state working|blocked|idle|done|unknown --source socket|hook [--session <id>]` |
| Plain stdout | no output |
| JSON stdout | exact result object |
| Exit codes | common |

Example:

```json
{"id":108,"cmd":"report-agent","surface":1,"state":"working","source":"socket","session":"abc"}
{"id":108,"ok":true,"data":{"surface":1,"state":"working","source":"socket","session":"abc"}}
```

## Proposed Hooks Config

Hooks are proposed protocol v6 config, not a socket command. They are declared in `~/.config/cmux/mux.json` under `hooks`.

Schema:

```text
object{
  hooks?: object{
    on-bell?: array<HookCommand>,
    on-agent-blocked?: array<HookCommand>,
    on-agent-done?: array<HookCommand>,
    on-surface-exit?: array<HookCommand>
  }
}

HookCommand =
  object{
    argv: array<string>,
    cwd?: string|null,
    timeout_ms?: uint64,
    env?: object<string,string>
  }
| object{
    command: string,
    cwd?: string|null,
    timeout_ms?: uint64,
    env?: object<string,string>
  }
```

Exactly one of `argv` or `command` is required. `argv` executes directly. `command` executes through the session shell as `shell -lc <command>`. The default timeout is 5000 ms. Hook failures are reported through the debug log and may post a `warning` notification; they must not block the mux event loop indefinitely.

Common environment:

| Env var | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CMUX_MUX_SESSION` | Session name |
| `CMUX_MUX_SOCKET` | Unix socket path when available |
| `CMUX_MUX_EVENT` | Hook event name |
| `CMUX_MUX_SURFACE` | Surface id when the event is surface-scoped |
| `CMUX_MUX_WORKSPACE` | Workspace id when known |
| `CMUX_MUX_SCREEN` | Screen id when known |
| `CMUX_MUX_PANE` | Pane id when known |
| `CMUX_MUX_AGENT_STATE` | Agent state for agent hooks |
| `CMUX_MUX_AGENT_SOURCE` | Agent source for agent hooks |
| `CMUX_MUX_AGENT_SESSION` | Upstream agent session id when reported |

Hook event mapping:

| Hook | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `on-bell` | Implemented `bell` event |
| `on-agent-blocked` | Proposed agent state becomes `blocked` |
| `on-agent-done` | Proposed agent state becomes `done` |
| `on-surface-exit` | Implemented surface exits and is reaped |

## Compatibility Notes

The following v5 behaviors are awkward for generated bindings and should be normalized in protocol v6:

| Area | v5 behavior | Proposed v6 normalization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create commands | `new-tab`, `new-browser-tab`, `new-screen`, `new-workspace`, and `split` return only `{surface}` | Return `{surface,pane,screen,workspace}` |
| Selection commands | `select-*` returns success for unknown targets, out-of-range indexes, and missing selector fields | Return a changed boolean or reject invalid target/index |
| Resize command | `resize-surface` does not report whether size changed or final clamped size | Return `{changed,cols,rows}` |
| Ratio command | `set-ratio` silently clamps and does not return final ratio | Return `{ratio}` after clamping |
| Naming commands | Empty string clears pane/surface/screen names but stores an empty workspace name | Make empty string clear all optional display names, including workspace |
| Attach response ordering | v5 `attach-surface` sends `vt-state` before the command response | v6 keeps attach as an event stream and adds `resized` replay events; clients must gate behavior by protocol |
| Error taxonomy | Errors are strings from `anyhow`, IO, base64, and terminal layers | Add stable machine error codes while preserving messages |
| Optional size pair | Supplying only one of `cols` or `rows` is silently ignored | Reject partial size pairs |
| Unknown fields | Unknown request fields are ignored by serde | Reject unknown fields or define extension slots |
