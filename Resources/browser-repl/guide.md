# `cmux browser repl`

Run JavaScript in a persistent JavaScriptCore session that drives the browser
panes of your cmux workspace. The API is Playwright: `page`, locators,
`keyboard`, `mouse`, events and waits behave as in Playwright. Input is native:
pages see trusted events.

## Usage

    cmux browser repl 'await page.goto("https://example.com"); snapshot()'
    cmux browser repl --eval - < script.js
    cmux browser repl --session work 'const s1 = await snapshot()'
    cmux browser repl list | reset <session> | guide

Without `--session` each call is one-shot: its tabs close at the end unless
`page.keep()` was called. With `--session NAME`, top-level `const`/`let`
bindings and tabs persist until `reset NAME` or 30 minutes idle. A session
binds to your cmux workspace, or to the focused workspace outside cmux.

- The last expression's value prints (a promise is awaited first);
  `undefined` prints nothing. `console.log()` prints too.
- 120 second timeout per call (`--timeout <ms>`).
- A call prints at most 25,000 characters (`--max-output <chars>`, `0` for
  no limit). Past that, its whole output goes to a file: the start, the
  last lines and the file's path print. Read the file with `fs` or your
  own tools.
- `page` is ready at once: the first use opens a tab. Nothing you do takes
  the user's focus: `tabs.open()`, input, dialogs and waking a tab never
  change the user's window, workspace, pane, tab or keyboard focus, also when
  the user works in the same workspace. Only `page.bringToFront()` shows a
  tab, and a `sites.browserAuth` sign-in sheet asks the user to type.

## Globals

- `page`: the current tab, a Playwright `Page` with a stable `page.id`.
- `tabs`: `list()`, `open(url, { background })`, `current()`, `use(tabOrId)`,
  `get(id)`. `list()` returns `{ id, title, url, active, current, state }`
  for every tab in the workspace without attaching or waking it; `list({ all: true })` adds the
  user's tabs in other workspaces and windows (with `workspace`), and
  `use(id)` takes any of them; `use(id)` and `get(id)` return a `Page`.
  `content({ urls, format })` loads URLs in background tabs and returns
  `[{ url, title, status, content }]` (`format`: `text`, `markdown`,
  `html`, `snapshot`) without changing the current tab.
  `history({ query, from, to, limit })` returns cmux browser history,
  newest first, as `{ url, title, dateVisited }`.
- `snapshot(target?, options?)`: accessibility snapshot of `page`, a locator or
  a ref. Options: `interactive` (controls plus headings and landmarks),
  `viewport` (only what is on screen), `showHidden`, `maxChars` (print
  budget, below), `options` (one line per option), and `urls` (every
  link's `[url=…]`; links with no name show it anyway).
- `screenshot(target?, options?)`: an image of the viewport, `{ fullPage }`, a
  locator or a ref. `{ annotate: true }` draws each ref's box and label.
  Printing an image saves it to a file and prints the path.
- `fetch(url, init)`: standard fetch with the current tab's cookies
  (`credentials: "same-origin"` or `"omit"` to send fewer); bodies over
  64 MiB fail, download those in a tab.
- `fs`, `path`, `os`, `Buffer`: Node APIs. Files are limited to the directory
  you ran the command in and the system temp directory. `import("node:fs")`
  and `require("fs")` return the same modules.
- `sleep(ms)`, `display(value)`, `console`.
- `session`: `name(label)` labels this session's tabs; `keep(page)` keeps a
  tab after a one-shot run; `id`; `guide()` returns this text.
  `allowedDomains(["example.com", "*.example.org"], { lock })`,
  `prohibitedDomains([...])` and `blockIPAddresses(true)` limit navigations,
  new tabs, `fetch` (every redirect), site tools and the subresources of
  tabs this session opened. A tab this session opened never loads a blocked page (the
  navigation is cancelled and the action fails); a tab you claimed stays
  where it is, but reads and input on it fail while it shows a blocked
  page. `blockedNavigations()` lists the blocks. The policy is enforced
  outside this JavaScript context, so `{ lock: true }` cannot be undone. `configure({ userAgent, extraHTTPHeaders, permissions, proxy })`
  sets browser-context options for the tabs this session opened (a tab you
  claimed keeps its own; `null` clears one; a proxy applies to tabs opened afterwards, in a private
  profile without your cookies). `storageState({ path })`
  and `setStorageState(stateOrPath)` save and restore cookies and
  localStorage (Playwright's format); a save covers the current tab's site
  only, `{ all: true }` the whole profile, `{ urls }` those URLs. `downloads()` lists downloads.
  `record()` returns a recorder; `stop()` writes `trace.jsonl`, a PNG per
  action and `run.png`, an animated PNG of the run.
- `secrets.set(name, value, { domains, totp })` or `secrets.load(file)`
  (`{ "<domain>": { name: value } }`) registers a secret; type it with
  `locator.fill(secret("name"))` or `locator.type(secret("name"))`. It is
  typed only into frames on its domains, and its value prints, reads and
  saves as `<secret:name>` everywhere. `{ totp: true }` types the current
  one-time code of a base32 seed.
- `search(query, { engine, limit })`: `[{ title, url, snippet }]` from
  DuckDuckGo (default), Bing or Google.
- `tools.register(name, fn, { description, params, domains })` adds a
  callable `tools.name(args)` to the session; `fn(args, { page, session,
  tabs })`; `params` like `{ q: "string", n: "number?" }` are checked.
- `page.exportContent()` writes the page as Markdown and returns the file's
  path; `{ format: "pdf" }` (or `md`, `docx`, `xlsx`, `csv`, `pptx`, ...)
  exports a Google Docs, Sheets or Slides tab; `{ transcript: true }` writes a
  YouTube watch page's captions as text.
- To drop files on a drop zone:
  `locator.dispatchEvent("drop", { dataTransfer: { files: [path or { name, mimeType, buffer }] } })`.

## Snapshot

    title: Sign up
    url: http://localhost:8765/
    - navigation "Main" [ref=e1]:
      - link "Home" [ref=e2]
    - main:
      - heading "Sign up" [level=1]
      - textbox "Email" [ref=e3] [placeholder="you@x.com"]: "me@x.com"
      - checkbox "Accept terms" [ref=e4] [checked]
      - combobox "Plan" [ref=e5] [options: Free, Pro, Team]: "Pro"
      - table "Scores":
        - row [header]: "Name | Score"
        - row:
          - cell: "Ada"
          - link "Profile" [ref=e6]
      - iframe "Payment" [ref=e7]:
        - textbox "Card" [ref=f1e1]

- Refs (`e5`, `f1e2` inside a frame) work anywhere a selector works:
  `page.locator("e5").click()`, `page.ref("e5")`, `snapshot("e5")`,
  `screenshot("e5")`. A ref names one element for its life and is never
  reused. A removed element's ref fails at once with `ref e5 is stale`; take
  a new snapshot then.
- Refs mark controls, iframes, scrollable regions and named landmarks,
  dialogs and lists. States: `[checked]`, `[checked=mixed]`, `[disabled]`,
  `[expanded]`, `[expanded=false]`, `[pressed]`, `[selected]`, `[focused]`,
  `[required]`, `[invalid]`, `[readonly]`, `[level=N]`, `[scrollable]`.
- Only what a user can see prints: collapsed, `display:none`,
  `content-visibility:hidden`, inert and `aria-hidden` content does not
  (`showHidden` adds it). Names come from content only for buttons, links,
  headings and similar leaves, so nothing prints twice. Tables print
  `row: "a | b"` when every cell is text; layout tables flatten.
- Frames (also cross-origin and nested) and shadow roots, closed ones too,
  are inlined; refs and locators work inside them.
- An open dialog or file chooser prints first, under the header.
- Printing a snapshot shows its diff against the previous snapshot of the
  same tab when that is shorter (for a large page, 30% shorter), else the
  full tree. `.tree` and `.diff` are always there. Diff lines start with `+`
  (added), `-` (removed) or `~` (changed, new version); unchanged ancestors
  are shown for context.
- A printed snapshot is at most 20,000 characters (`maxChars`). A larger
  page prints condensed: on-screen controls, the focused element and the
  headings and landmarks first, then the page from the top; long runs of
  similar items (list items, rows, cards) keep their first few. Each cut
  is one line, `- … 480 more listitem (480 refs): snapshot("e12")`, and a
  last `# condensed …` line says what is left out. Refs in the cut part
  work. For more: `snapshot("e12")` for that region,
  `snapshot({ viewport: true })` after scrolling, or
  `snapshot({ maxChars: Infinity })` and `.tree` for everything (search
  `.tree` in code rather than printing it).
- Refs stay valid until their element is removed, also when its name or
  state changes, so there is no need to take a new snapshot after every
  action; a stale ref fails at once and says so.

## Dialogs and file choosers

With a `page.on("dialog")` or `page.on("filechooser")` listener (including
`waitForEvent`), Playwright rules apply. Without one, in a tab you opened, the
dialog or chooser stays open and shows in the snapshot. While a JavaScript
dialog is open the page cannot run script, so page calls fail with a message
that says so. A tab you did not open (`tabs.use()` of the user's tab) is the
user's: its dialogs, file choosers, downloads and permission prompts go to
the user unless you have a listener for that event on the page, or your own
click, key, drag, navigation or `page.evaluate()` (within its first
second) opened the dialog or chooser, which then comes to you as in a tab you opened; a window your
action opens there comes to you as a `popup` and stays the user's tab. A dialog
that opens during Meta+C, Meta+X or Meta+V is dismissed at once, so it
cannot hold the clipboard command; listeners still get it, and the next
snapshot prints `dialog dismissed: ...` once.

    page.dialog()        // { type, message, defaultValue, accept(text?), dismiss() } or null
    page.fileChooser()   // { multiple, setFiles(paths), cancel() } or null

## Hibernated and crashed tabs

`state` in `tabs.list()` is `live`, `hibernated` (cmux unloaded the hidden
page to save memory), `waking` (it is loading again) or `crashed`. Any call
on a hibernated tab loads it again first, in the background, and waits up to
30 s; it fails with `hibernated` when the user stopped that load or it ended
without a page, and with a timeout when it is still loading (retry). A
crashed tab fails every call but navigation with `crashed`; call
`page.reload()` or `page.goto(url)`. Errors name the tab as
`tab <id> ("title", url)`.

## Page additions

- `page.consoleMessages({ level, filter, limit })`, `page.errors()`: console
  and uncaught-error history of the tab.
- `page.clipboard`: `readText()`, `writeText(text)`, `read()`, `write(items)`
  on the tab's own clipboard, which Meta+C, Meta+X and Meta+V use. Those
  shortcuts work only in tabs you opened; a page that keeps one running
  past 5 s crashes its tab (`page.reload()` brings it back). In tabs you
  opened, what the page's own scripts copy (a Copy button's
  `navigator.clipboard.writeText` or `execCommand("copy")` after your
  click) also lands here, never on the system clipboard, so
  `page.clipboard.readText()` returns it.
- `page.elementAt(x, y)`: `{ ref, role, name, box }` at a viewport point.
- `page.keep()`: keep this tab after a one-shot run.
- `page.markdown({ main, links, images, start, maxChars })`: the page as
  Markdown with iframes and shadow roots in place; `main: true` keeps the
  main content; a cut ends with where to continue.
- `page.extract({ $: ".item", name: "h3", url: "a@href", tags: ["li"] })`:
  structured data by selectors; `"sel@attr"` reads an attribute, `["sel"]`
  every match, `{ $: sel, ...fields }` one object per match.
- `page.searchText(pattern, { regex, caseSensitive, context, scope, limit })`:
  `{ total, matches: [{ match, context, ref }] }`.
- `page.scrollToText(text)` (returns the ref), `page.scroll({ pages, target })`
  (native wheel, negative pages scroll up), `page.scrollInfo(target?)`
  (`{ y, pagesAbove, pagesBelow, ... }`).
- `page.dropdownOptions(ref)`: options of a `<select>` or an open ARIA
  combobox, listbox or menu, with refs for ARIA options.
- `page.highlight(targets?)`, `page.hideHighlight()`, `locator.highlight()`:
  boxes and ref labels on the page.

## Tips

- Read with `snapshot({ interactive: true })` first, then `snapshot()`.
- Act with refs or Playwright locators; after an action, print `snapshot()`
  again to see what changed.
- Actions wait for the element as Playwright does. A stale ref fails fast.
- Downloads: `const d = page.waitForEvent("download"); await page.click(...);
  (await d).path()` gives a readable file.
