# Changelog

## [0.65.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added
- `cmux session move <session-id> --to <ssh-destination|local>` moves a stopped Claude Code session, its transcript, memory and git working tree, between this Mac and an SSH host and resumes it there ([#14959](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14959))
- Claude Code and Codex agents on a `cmux ssh` host show Running, Needs input, or Idle in the sidebar; cmux installs their hooks on the host when the Integrations toggles are on, including under proxy or account-switching launchers ([#14902](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14902), [#14908](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14908))

- `cmux resize-window --window <handle> --width <w> --height <h>` resizes a window from the CLI or socket, keeping its top-left corner in place ([#9826](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9826)) -- thanks @ejc3!
- Global search finds text in the scrollback of open terminals, and Return on a terminal hit opens that pane's find bar on the match ([#11665](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/11665)) -- thanks @smoreg, and thanks @azooz2003-bit for the report!
- Open Folder dialogs have a New Folder button, so you can create a directory and open it as a workspace without going to Finder ([#5559](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5559)) -- thanks @bcharleson!
- `cmux sessions --json` shows `launch_rejection_reason`, explaining why a captured agent launch command was rejected for restore ([#10347](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10347), [#10440](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10440)) -- thanks @smoreg, and thanks @WTF-Am-ID for the report!
- `agents.launchers` in `cmux.json` declares an external wrapper (such as a multi-account router) so session restore resumes the agent through it instead of dropping it ([#10503](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10503)) -- thanks @smoreg!
- My Devices can discover your other Macs on the same account (opt-in) and open their workspaces as mirrors that keep splits, tab order, and scrollback ([#12105](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12105), [#13472](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13472))

- A managed `SocketControlMode` profile key (`com.cmuxterm.app`) forces the automation socket to `cmuxOnly` or `off`, and `cmux socket-status --json` reports the effective mode ([#12955](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12955))
- `cmux config doctor` (also `check` and `validate`) checks cmux.json values against the settings schema, and invalid setting writes from the CLI or Settings leave the file unchanged ([#13146](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13146))
- The Command Palette can launch Claude Code Teams and Codex Teams in a new terminal tab when those agents are installed ([#13147](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13147))

- `cmux.json` can list local config packs under `packs` (directories resolve through `cmux.pack.json`), adding their actions, commands, workspaces, and buttons; direct config still wins ([#13356](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13356))
- The terminal scrollbar shows a marker for each submitted agent prompt; click a marker to jump to that prompt in scrollback ([#13595](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13595)) -- thanks @hamaney for the report!
- Settings > Sidebar > Workspace Description Color (`sidebar.workspaceDescriptionColor`) sets the sidebar workspace description color; unset, it follows the theme ([#13597](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13597)) -- thanks @godfreyponce for the report!
- Swap With Session… in the terminal context menu and command palette lets you click another pane to swap places with; Escape cancels ([#13601](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13601)) -- thanks @moonfruit for the report!

- After relaunch, restored zsh and Bash terminals recall their own commands first in shell history; new terminals keep global history ([#13851](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13851))
- Cmd-clicking a file path printed in a `cmux ssh` terminal downloads the remote file and opens it in cmux's preview, instead of doing nothing or opening a same-named local file ([#13866](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13866))
- Settings > Terminal > Text Editing Gestures (`terminal.textEditingGestures`, off by default) makes Cmd/Option arrows and deletes move and delete by line and word at the shell prompt ([#13921](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13921))

- Settings > Terminal > Password Input Indicator (`terminal.showPasswordInputIndicator`, on by default) shows a lock badge while a program reads a password with echo off; Show Typed Password Dots adds one dot per key ([#14867](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14867), [#14905](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14905))

- cmux TUI: short aliases (`ws`, `p`, `ls`, `rm`) and tmux-style commands (`splitw`, `selectp`, `neww`, `send-keys` and more); `cmux help shorthands` lists them ([#12863](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12863))

- Close confirmation dialogs for tabs, panes and workspaces have a "Don’t ask again" checkbox that turns off the warning behind that dialog; "Close pinned workspace?" still always asks ([#15052](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/15052))
- `cmux.copyWorkingDirectory`, `cmux.copyProjectRoot`, and `cmux.copyScreen` built-in actions copy a terminal's working directory, its git project root, or its visible screen from a tab bar button, shortcut, or the Command Palette ([#14858](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14858))

- The first-launch welcome banner prints from shell startup instead of typing `cmux welcome`, so it no longer lands in your shell history ([#14809](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14809), [#14857](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14857))

- Unfocused terminal panes redraw at about 30 FPS, so agents streaming into background panes cost less; scrolling an unfocused pane is also paced until it takes focus ([#14843](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14843))
- Shortcut hint pills, titlebar controls and button hover highlights appear instantly and only fade out, the pane drop-zone overlay no longer slides between zones, and canvas focus moves pan only when the target pane is off screen ([#14984](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14984))

### Fixed
- VoiceOver no longer reads a symbol name such as "gearshape" or "Mostly Cloudy" before each Settings sidebar entry ([#14989](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14989))
- VoiceOver now names the browser toolbar's Back, Forward, Reload/Stop, Developer Tools, Profile, and Theme buttons and the notification clear buttons, no longer reads internal command ids on command palette rows, and the Xcode project panel's reload, dismiss, picker, and status text is localized ([#14926](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14926)).
- The Settings notification sound preview button has a tooltip and VoiceOver label, and German, French, Spanish, Arabic, Korean, and Chinese menus and buttons no longer show the wrong sense of Clear, Open, Back, Refresh, Preview, Rename, Stop, or Fork (for example German "Klar" instead of "Löschen", or Spanish "Abierto" instead of "Abrir") ([#14983](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14983)).
- In canvas mode, panes an agent or the CLI creates no longer scroll the canvas away from what you're watching, socket canvas commands apply without animation, and canvas pans and the overview toggle respect Reduce Motion ([#14939](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14939))
- Hovering a command palette or session index row no longer looks as strong as (or erases) the selection; terminal and browser find fields show a focus stroke; group header unread badges follow the Notification Badge color; and the feed's Deny and Allow Once buttons stay visible in both light and dark mode ([#14941](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14941)).
- Hovering a sidebar workspace swaps its unread badge for the close button in the same frame, feed selection with j/k no longer eases between rows, clearing a notification closes the gap at once, and holding Command no longer animates unrelated right sidebar changes ([#14927](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14927)).
- In a split, a pane you switch to no longer shows a dimmed frame before it brightens; the unfocused-pane dim now changes in the same frame as focus ([#14892](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14892)).
- Clicking a sidebar workspace keeps its highlight steady while the selection lands, instead of flickering off when the pointer moves away, and rapid clicks never show two rows selected ([#14871](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14871)).
- Closing a workspace no longer briefly flashes the close (X) button on every sidebar row, and the X no longer appears on the row that slides under a context menu's old position ([#14826](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14826)).
- Closing or creating a workspace no longer rebuilds every sidebar row, so a rename, checklist edit, or popover open on another row survives it ([#14866](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14866)).
- In pane tab bars, the tab that slides under the pointer after a close shows its hover and close button without moving the mouse, and VoiceOver can close any tab with a Close Tab action ([manaflow-ai/bonsplit#253](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/bonsplit/pull/253), [#14885](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14885)).
- Context-menu submenus built with `Menu` in custom sidebars appear instead of being dropped ([#14808](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14808)) -- thanks @aliyansajid!
- Closing the last workspace no longer unfolds a collapsed sidebar group above it ([#10169](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10169)) -- thanks @AvoChang!
- The focused pane border follows a zoomed terminal or browser pane instead of remaining at its pre-zoom split size, including when window chrome changes the overlay reference coordinates ([#14646](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14646)) -- thanks @classicluna!
- Reopening an agent pane no longer tries to resume through the pane's shell (for example `bash --resume <id>`) when the captured launch command was the shell bootstrap ([#5848](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5848)) -- thanks @STRML!
- Edits to a symlinked `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json` apply on reload instead of needing an app restart ([#8562](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/8562)) -- thanks @lucidash!
- `cmux ssh-tmux <host> --new-window` works in release builds instead of failing with `method_not_found` ([#8608](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/8608)) -- thanks @thejiajun!
- Agent hook commands no longer leave idle cmux app processes running when CLI forwarding loops back to the app binary ([#8788](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/8788)) -- thanks @kunsanglee!
- Signing in with a YubiKey or other hardware security key in the browser no longer crashes cmux when the key returns no user handle ([#9060](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9060)) -- thanks @marius-jacobs!
- The Files pane shows files added or removed inside an expanded folder, keeping expanded folders and the selection ([#9589](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9589)) -- thanks @jiancui-research!
- Remote PTY sessions report `TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` instead of inheriting the remote host's terminal identity ([#9610](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9610)) -- thanks @hdimer!
- cmux no longer crashes when a `cmux` command (for example from a shell rc file) arrives while the previous session is still restoring at launch ([#9627](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9627)) -- thanks @hdimer, and thanks @bondijois for the report!
- Double-clicking the empty sidebar area runs your `ui.newWorkspace.action`, like the `+` button and File > New Workspace ([#10248](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10248)) -- thanks @smoreg, and thanks @CarlRodabaugh for the report!
- A finished Claude subagent no longer marks the pane as needing input while the main agent is still working ([#10343](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10343)) -- thanks @smoreg, and thanks @Daniel-Brestoiu for the report!
- Agent spinner titles keep animating in the tab without waking the sidebar and titlebar on every frame ([#10351](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10351)) -- thanks @STRML!

- A terminal editor such as `nvim` set as the preferred editor no longer leaves hidden editor processes running; cmux opens the file with the system default app instead ([#10681](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10681)) -- thanks @josonchou for the report!
- `cmux events` run from outside cmux shows a clear access-denied message instead of a JSON parse error ([#10712](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10712)) -- thanks @taiseii for the report!
- Remote tmux (beta): `cmux ssh-tmux` mirrored splits keep pane titles set in tmux (for example with `select-pane -T`) instead of showing only the window name and index ([#10714](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10714))
- The native resize cursor appears at the main window's edges instead of being covered by the terminal cursor ([#10835](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10835)) -- thanks @ctopherwilliams for the report!
- The sidebar edge, tab bar underline, and pane borders are visible in light mode ([#10967](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10967)) -- thanks @lrytz!

## [0.64.25] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- The persistent "Terminal is not rendering" banner no longer covers terminal panes; render-health recovery, logs, and socket fields are unchanged ([#12738](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12738)).

### Fixed
- SSH workspaces connect again in released builds: the app ships a checksum-verified `cmuxd-remote` for macOS and Linux, and the release pipeline rejects a build whose daemon manifest and assets disagree ([#12720](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12720)) -- thanks @john-agi for the report!
- An SSH terminal no longer sits at `Last login` forever when its remote session cannot become ready: the session parks within 60 seconds, the pane and sidebar show the same actionable error, and Reconnect works afterwards ([#12851](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12851)).
- SSH terminals stay in raw input mode across attach and reconnect instead of falling back to echoing, line-buffered input, and a remote daemon whose version does not match the app is rejected before it touches the terminal ([#12726](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12726)).
- Splits and new terminals in an SSH workspace open in the focused pane's remote directory instead of the remote home directory ([#12054](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12054)) -- thanks @zhiyuanzhai for the report!
- Agents resumed with `cmux restore` or `cmux fork` receive terminal resizes again, so their layout no longer garbles after a restore or pane resize ([#12796](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12796)) -- thanks @rizkidarmawan21 for the report!
- Images dropped or pasted into a terminal stay on disk until cmux quits so Claude Code and Codex can read them, and a copied image that also carries a source URL pastes as an image ([#12752](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12752)) -- thanks @mgayaud-meridian for the report!
- With System appearance, a terminal no longer reloads its dark theme after macOS switches to light ([#12811](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12811)), and Light applies the light palette when the Ghostty config sets only non-color options such as a font, keybinding, or opacity ([#12812](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12812)).

## [0.64.24] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Cloud file transfers use private SCP, and iOS Computer details can delete non-IROH routes without losing the computer ([`5f0ce77`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/5f0ce77cab82ad60496175b222ec50a0b749085f), [#12691](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12691)) -- thanks @azooz2003-bit!

### Changed
- Cloud Desktop restores authenticated transport, saved splits, and noVNC recovery; Cloud folder drags use the sidebar insertion line and persist across refreshes ([#12633](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12633), [#12589](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12589)).
- Browser feature-flag evaluations reuse complete results for five minutes, while Computer Use onboarding and preference notifications avoid startup deadlocks ([#12611](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12611), [`3a617be`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/3a617be7cd)).
- The Cloud guest CLI accepts `workspace close --workspace ... --focus false`, and CLI authorization can switch browser accounts without losing the login code ([#12470](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12470), [#12679](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12679)).

### Fixed
- Codex `--yolo` no longer calls a missing resume helper or recursively injects restore commands after repeated resumes ([#12659](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12659), [#12697](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12697)).
- Terminal panes publish their final size after pane and window geometry settles, preventing transient dimensions from corrupting TUI output ([#12662](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12662)).
- Runaway memory guardrails default to off for new configurations, and internal memory-pressure diagnostics no longer create user notifications ([#12658](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12658), [#12667](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12667)).

- iOS (beta): New Browser creates and streams a real Mac browser pane; streamed pages get a first frame without reload, focus fields under taps, and stop stray backspace navigation ([#9577](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9577), [#9498](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9498), [#9729](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9729)) -- thanks @azooz2003-bit!
- iOS (beta): reconnecting is quiet (title-bar spinner, terminal stays interactive), and workspace state, selection, artifacts, and open terminals survive reconnects and Mac switches ([#10821](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10821), [#11879](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/11879), [#12000](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12000), [#9979](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9979), [#10121](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10121), [#10010](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10010), [#11328](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/11328), [`a028ba2`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/a028ba24e17a311f2023e91efc48a8e4a4555076)) -- thanks @azooz2003-bit!

- The browser toolbar keeps Design Mode, profile, theme, and Inspect in the row and moves Focus Mode and screenshots into a More menu ([#10460](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10460))
- Every Vault resume entry point uses the shell-free `cmux restore` path, and Vault rows drop onto terminal and browser panes through one router ([#9924](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9924), [#9964](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9964), [#10032](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10032))

- Fail closed when `close` or `respawn-pane` is given an explicit `--surface` that no longer exists, instead of acting on a different live surface ([#9422](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/9422)) -- thanks @PhilipPinckaers for the report!
