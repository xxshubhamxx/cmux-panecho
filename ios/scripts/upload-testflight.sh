Usage:
  ios/scripts/upload-testflight.sh [--lane beta] [--build-number <number>]
                                  [--signing manual|automatic] [--external]
                                  [--archive-path <path>] [--export-only]

Archives cmux iOS, exports an App Store Connect IPA, and uploads it to
TestFlight. The default lane is beta:

  bundle id: dev.cmux.app.beta
  profile:   cmux Beta Distribution

On the manual signing path the exported app is RE-SIGNED with the full
entitlements before upload. The archive is built unsigned (to avoid
distribution-cert churn), so -exportArchive re-adds only the profile baseline
and silently DROPS app-capability entitlements like aps-environment. That is
the https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5496 regression that killed
beta/prod push. A config-level entitlements file alone does not prove the
entitlement reaches the signed binary; only codesign -d --entitlements on the
exported app does. So the re-sign merges Config/cmux-release.entitlements into
the export baseline and signs with the local distribution cert, gated on
codesign showing aps-environment and a strict signature verify.

Authentication uses one of:

  ASC_API_KEY_ID
  ASC_API_ISSUER_ID
  ASC_API_KEY_PATH

or a local plist at:

  ios/Config/AppStoreConnect.local.plist

with string keys:

  ASC_API_KEY_ID
  ASC_API_ISSUER_ID
  ASC_API_KEY_PATH

or:

  APPLE_ID
  APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD
  APPLE_PROVIDER_PUBLIC_ID

Options:
  --lane <beta>             Distribution lane. Only beta is currently defined.
  --build-number <number>   CFBundleVersion. Defaults to UTC yyyyMMddHHmmss.
                            Self-healed up to (App Store Connect max + 1) if it
                            would not be the highest build (TestFlight only offers
                            the highest build as an update).
  --signing <mode>          Export signing mode: manual (default) or automatic.
                            manual uses the "Apple Distribution" certificate and
                            the "cmux Beta Distribution" provisioning profile from
                            the local keychain (for local/dev exports). automatic
                            uses Xcode cloud-managed signing via the ASC API key
                            and -allowProvisioningUpdates, so CI does not need an
                            iOS distribution cert/profile in the keychain.
  --external                Make the build eligible for EXTERNAL TestFlight
                            testers (sets testFlightInternalTestingOnly=NO).
                            Default is internal-only: builds reach internal
                            groups (e.g. "cmux beta") instantly but can never
                            be added to an external group. External-eligible
                            builds must pass Apple Beta App Review (~24h) before
                            external testers can install. Also set via
                            CMUX_TESTFLIGHT_EXTERNAL=1.
  --archive-path <path>     Reuse an existing archive instead of archiving.
  --export-only             Stop after exporting the signed IPA.
  --skip-notes              Do not set the TestFlight "What to Test" notes after
                            upload. By default a successful upload pushes the top
                            ios/CHANGELOG.md entry to the build (the Internal block,
                            or the External block with --external). Also via
                            CMUX_TESTFLIGHT_SKIP_NOTES=1.

# Re-sign the exported app with the FULL entitlements (production aps-environment
# et al.), then point $IPA_PATH at the re-signed IPA so the upload below ships it.
#
# Why this is necessary for the manual path: the archive is built UNSIGNED
# (CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO, see above) to keep distribution material off shared
# fleet builders. An unsigned archive carries NO entitlements, so
# `-exportArchive` re-adds only the profile baseline (application-identifier,
# com.apple.developer.team-identifier, get-task-allow, beta-reports-active) and
# SILENTLY DROPS app-capability entitlements such as aps-environment. This
# regressed in
# https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5496 (June 2026): the signed beta IPA
# had aps-environment absent entirely, so the device registered no push token and
# beta/prod push was dead. The per-config entitlements file fix
# (Config/cmux-release.entitlements) is necessary but NOT sufficient on its own:
# a config-level entitlement only ships if it survives into the signed binary,
# and only `codesign -d --entitlements` on the EXPORTED app proves that. So we
# re-sign here with the export baseline MERGED with the Release entitlements file.
#
# The merged set MUST then be reconciled against the provisioning profile, in
# both directions (hit 2026-06-11, ASC error 90163): App Store Connect rejects
# any signed entitlement key the profile does not authorize. The Release file
# carries com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive, the App ID has
# the capability enabled, but the installed "cmux Beta Distribution" profile
# predates it and does not list the key, so a naive baseline+Release merge is
# rejected at upload ("bundle contains a key not in the provisioning profile").
# The same naive merge also SHIPS WITHOUT keychain-access-groups (authorized by
# the profile but absent from both the export baseline and the Release file).
# So below we (1) seed from the profile's own Entitlements dict, the exact set
# ASC validates against, and (2) drop any merged key the profile does not
# authorize, warning per key. Restoring a dropped capability (e.g.
# time-sensitive) requires REGENERATING the profile so it snapshots the App
# ID's current capabilities, not editing this script or the Release file.
#
# This runs on the MANUAL signing path only: it re-signs with the named
# distribution cert from the local keychain ("Apple Distribution: Manaflow,
# Inc."), which is present for local/fleet-archive beta cuts. The cmux iOS app is
# a single self-contained bundle (no Frameworks/, no PlugIns/, GhosttyKit is
# static), so only the top-level .app is signed; there is no nested code to
# re-sign. Two alternatives were ruled out: an ad-hoc archive (CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY
# "-") is rejected by the iOS SDK for an entitled app, and signing on the shared
# fleet would put distribution material on shared Macs.
