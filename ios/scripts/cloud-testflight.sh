#
# The heavy GhosttyKit + Swift Release compile runs on a leased fleet Mac (the
# same maclease pool/exclusions reload-cloud-ios uses, m1ultra excluded). The
# fleet builds an UNSIGNED Release archive for the beta bundle id
# (dev.cmux.app.beta): no signing material ever lands on the shared Macs (they
# also run GitHub Actions, i.e. arbitrary PR code). The archive is downloaded
# locally and handed to ios/scripts/upload-testflight.sh --archive-path, which
# does the local export, re-sign with the Apple Distribution cert (re-adding
# aps-environment=production), strict codesign verification, and TestFlight
# upload.
#
# The cloud build is provided by the cmuxterm-hq script scripts/reload-cloud-ios.sh
# (located the same way the worktree shim ios/scripts/reload-cloud.sh finds it).
# That script also owns builder resilience: an unreachable leased slot is released
# and the next builder is tried, and beta-archive mode applies a pre-build disk
# floor (RELOAD_CLOUD_IOS_MIN_FREE_GB, default 20G) so a nearly-full fleet host
# (cmux-aws-m4pro routinely sits ~99.7% APFS-full) is skipped instead of dying
# mid-archive; it also prunes its remote work dir after the download. A standalone
# cmux clone with no hq checkout transparently falls back to a LOCAL Release
# archive on this Mac. Either way the archive is then handed to
# upload-testflight.sh, so the export/re-sign/verify/upload path is identical.
#
# Relies on the upload-testflight.sh re-sign + aps-environment=production gate
# (shipped with this lane; a superset of the copy in PR
# https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5647 with the same re-sign/gates plus
# main's --external support preserved) to make a push-working beta. This lane
# only feeds the archive in; it deliberately does NOT duplicate that signing
# logic. Without the re-sign, the export still runs but the unsigned archive's
# export carries NO aps-environment at all (profile-baseline entitlements
# only), so push would be silently dead; the --no-upload gate below catches
# exactly that.
#
# FIRST EXTERNAL BUILD OF A VERSION: an --external build must pass a one-time
# Apple Beta App Review (~24h) before external testers can install it. Internal
# testers (the "cmux beta" group) get every build instantly with no review.

Usage: ios/scripts/cloud-testflight.sh [--no-upload] [--external] [--tag <tag>] [--marketing-version <X.Y.Z>]
                                       [--host <name>] [--wait <seconds>]
                                       [--local] [--keep-artifacts]

Build an UNSIGNED Release archive for the cmux iOS beta on a leased fleet Mac,
download it, then export/re-sign/verify/upload via upload-testflight.sh.

  --no-upload        Dry run. Stop after the local export + re-sign + strict
                     codesign verification (aps-environment=production); do NOT
                     upload to TestFlight. Maps to upload-testflight.sh
                     --export-only.
  --external         Make the build eligible for EXTERNAL TestFlight testers
                     (requires a one-time Apple Beta App Review per version).
                     Default is internal-only (instant for the "cmux beta" group).
  --tag <tag>        Build tag for the lease description / remote work dir
                     (default: beta). Does not change the bundle id.
  --host <name>      Force a specific fleet builder (skips host preference).
  --wait <seconds>   Block up to this long for a free cloud builder before
                     falling back to a local build (default 1200).
  --local            Build the Release archive locally on this Mac instead of the
                     fleet. Used automatically when no hq cloud script is present.
  --skip-notes       Do not set the build's TestFlight "What to Test" notes after
                     upload. By default a successful upload pushes the top
                     ios/CHANGELOG.md entry (Internal block, or External with
                     --external) so testers see what changed.
  --keep-artifacts   Keep the downloaded archive + export dir.

Signing/upload credentials are resolved by upload-testflight.sh (ASC API key via
ASC_API_KEY_ID/ASC_API_ISSUER_ID/ASC_API_KEY_PATH or
ios/Config/AppStoreConnect.local.plist; the Apple Distribution cert in the local
keychain for the re-sign).
