/// - The "Mac" (the test) echoes an effective grid back through
///   `applyConfirmedViewSize` — in production this echo is the async
///   `store.updateTerminalViewport` RPC reply, so echoes can arrive LATE and
///   OUT OF ORDER relative to newer reports.
/// - Mac window resizes arrive as daemon pushes through `applyViewSize`.
///
/// The user-visible invariant under test: empty space above the terminal
/// content (`renderRect.minY`, the render is bottom-pinned) never exceeds one
/// cell once the negotiated grid covers the phone's natural capacity. The
/// opencode "ton of extra space at top" screenshot is exactly this invariant
/// breaking: a stale keyboard-up viewport echo landing after the keyboard
/// closed pins the phone to the old, smaller grid forever.
