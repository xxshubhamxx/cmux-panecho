/// Regression coverage for issue #6634: the left-edge swipe-back must return to
/// the workspace list even when a terminal or browser surface is on screen.
///
/// The full end-to-end gesture coexistence is a UIKit-runtime behavior that only
/// a driven UI test could exercise, and `cmuxUITests` is skipped on the
/// pull-request simulator lane. These tests instead lock the two code-level
/// decisions the fix turns on:
///   1. the navigation pop gesture recognizes simultaneously with the pushed
///      surface's own scroll/pan recognizers (the terminal's full-bounds
///      scroll-mechanics `UIScrollView`, the browser's `WKWebView` scroll view),
///      which UIKit's default coexistence rule provided until we replaced the
///      pop gesture's delegate; and
///   2. the browser's web view does not install its own competing left-edge
///      back-swipe.
