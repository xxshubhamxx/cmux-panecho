# cmux iOS

SwiftUI iOS/iPadOS shell for the CMUXMobileCore production path.

Current phase:

- Stack Auth sign-in gate with Apple, Google, email code, and a debug-only `42` shortcut
- QR/manual pairing surface
- CMUXMobileCore pairing payload and attach-ticket decoding
- injectable `CmxByteTransportFactory` runtime hook
- isolated preview host data when no concrete transport is installed
- workspace list, workspace detail, terminal dropdown, and input bar

No Rust, Iroh, or Zig dependency is linked into this shell. Concrete route implementations should enter through `CMUXMobileRuntime`.

Build and reload the simulator:

```bash
ios/scripts/reload.sh --tag iossh
```

Run package tests:

```bash
swift test --package-path ios/cmuxPackage
```

## TestFlight beta (cloud lane)

`ios/scripts/cloud-testflight.sh` is the turnkey lane for cutting a TestFlight
beta. It builds the heavy GhosttyKit + Swift Release compile on a leased fleet
Mac (same maclease pool as the device cloud reload, m1ultra excluded), so the
build stays off this Mac's CPU. The fleet produces an UNSIGNED Release archive
for the beta bundle id `dev.cmux.app.beta` (no signing material ever lands on
the shared Macs), downloads it locally, then hands it to
`ios/scripts/upload-testflight.sh --archive-path`, which does the local export,
re-sign with the Apple Distribution cert (re-adding `aps-environment=production`),
strict codesign verification, and TestFlight upload.

```bash
# Dry run: build + export + re-sign + verify aps-environment=production, NO upload
ios/scripts/cloud-testflight.sh --no-upload

# Full lane: build on the fleet and upload to TestFlight (internal "cmux beta" group)
ios/scripts/cloud-testflight.sh

# Also make the build eligible for external testers
ios/scripts/cloud-testflight.sh --external
```

A standalone cmux clone with no cmuxterm-hq checkout transparently falls back to
a LOCAL Release archive (`--local` forces it), then takes the same export path.

Internal testers (the `cmux beta` group) get every uploaded build instantly with
no review. An `--external` build is different: the FIRST external build of a new
`MARKETING_VERSION` must pass a one-time Apple Beta App Review (~24h) before any
external tester can install it. Subsequent external builds of the same version
ship without re-review. Plan a version bump's first external cut around that
~24h gate.

## TestFlight GitHub Actions signing

`.github/workflows/ios-testflight.yml` uses manual export signing because Xcode's
automatic App Store Connect export has produced IPAs whose signed app entitlements
omit `aps-environment=production`. That upload is intentionally blocked because
TestFlight push would silently fail.

Required GitHub secrets:

- `ASC_API_KEY_ID`
- `ASC_API_ISSUER_ID`
- `ASC_API_KEY_P8_BASE64`
- `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` (base64-encoded `.p12` for an Apple Distribution certificate on team `7WLXT3NR37`)
- `IOS_DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `IOS_BETA_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` (base64-encoded App Store profile for `dev.cmux.app.beta`, with `aps-environment=production`)
