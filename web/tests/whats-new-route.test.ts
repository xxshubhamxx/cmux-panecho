 * Channel targeting for What's New (Guideline 2.2, submission 591a59e6):
 * the served list may carry per-entry `entryChannels` and per-announcement
 * `channels` so specific content can be opted into the official App Store
 * channel ("prod") remotely; everything else defaults on device to the team
 * lanes only. The route must validate those lists at build time because an
 * unknown or empty channel list fails closed (invisible) on device.
