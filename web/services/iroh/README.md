# Iroh trust broker

The broker is scoped to the authenticated Stack `user.id`. Team membership and
the legacy team device registry never grant Iroh discovery or pairing access.

Registration signatures may carry the native Iroh `watch_addr` shape, but the
server strips every direct/private address before repository persistence. Direct
paths stay device-local or move endpoint-to-endpoint after admission. The broker
persists and publishes only exact managed relay URLs. Endpoint or
identity-generation replacement requires explicit revocation and reapproval; a
signature from only the proposed new key cannot replace an active binding.

A signed registration may publish `directPorts` with independent IPv4 and IPv6
UDP ports. The broker stores only those bounded ports, never a private address,
and returns them as `direct_ports` only inside the authenticated same-account
binding catalog. Clients combine a family-matching port with locally known
addresses after EndpointID authentication. Legacy registrations omit the field
and clear any previously published ports on their next signed refresh.

`relay_fleet` is the server-configured connection preset/allowlist. It is not a
peer address. Each peer's published `relay_url` comes from its signed
`watch_addr` payload and must match that allowlist. Discovery defensively
filters older rows to the same relay-only policy.

Discovery runs the user-scoped retention cleanup before reading. It removes
expired hints from binding JSON, challenges more than 24 hours past expiry or
consumption, and pair/relay audit rows more than 30 days beyond their useful
window. Revocation clears hints immediately. Once a revoked binding is at least
30 days old and its pair/relay audit rows have reached their own retention
limit, cleanup deletes the binding's EndpointID, device/app UUIDs, tag, and
display name. The hourly `/api/internal/iroh/retention` cron applies the same
policy across inactive accounts; responses also filter expired hints
defensively.

The LAN rendezvous key is HMAC-derived from an independent random server secret,
the exact Stack user id, and an account generation. Discovery reads active
bindings in stable UUID order, 128 rows per page. Its opaque cursor carries the
generation and last binding id; registration and revocation rotate the
generation whenever the active set changes, so a later page cannot mix tuples
from opposite sides of a mutation. Legacy requests without `page_size` receive
at most 256 bindings and no cursor, keeping old clients within their decoder
limit while upgraded clients traverse every page. Sign-out callers must invoke
the authenticated revoke route with their captured binding id before discarding
the Stack credential.

There is no total active-binding limit per account or device. Relay-token and
relay-preference requests use the optional Vercel Firewall rules as their
deployed ingress budget. A deliberate DEV-only bypass is available only when
the deployment opts in, uses the development Stack project, presents a tagged
debug namespace, and authenticates a member of the configured internal Stack
team. Release and internal-beta namespaces never qualify, and a Stack or
snapshot lookup failure falls back to the normal limiter.

Registration bootstraps a relay credential only when it creates a binding.
Signed refreshes of the same binding return `relay.status = "not_requested"`;
clients retain their existing credential or use the dedicated relay-token route
when its refresh window arrives. Platform is part of the immutable binding
identity and requires explicit revocation before it can change.

The n0-hosted relay minter is an optional compatibility path. When
`CMUX_IROH_MINT_URL` and `CMUX_IROH_MINT_HMAC_SECRET_B64` are absent, initial
registration returns `relay.status = "unavailable"` without rolling back the
binding. Current clients obtain endpoint-bound credentials for the self-hosted
fleet from `/api/relay/token`.

Every user-scoped mutation acquires the account-deletion advisory fence before
any Iroh lock. If the deletion tombstone wins, no challenge, binding, grant, or
relay audit state can be created. If an Iroh mutation wins, account deletion
waits for that transaction and then removes its rows. Pair grants re-read and
lock both exact signed peers at audit insertion, requiring an iOS initiator and
a pairable Mac acceptor. Relay credentials are returned only after a second
locked active-binding check following the external mint.

Registration stores the earliest managed-relay expiry in
`path_hints_next_expiry`. The hourly cleanup uses that indexed scalar and
bounded 500-row `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` batches for relay hints, challenges,
audit rows, and revoked bindings. Concurrent cron workers can cooperate without
a full-table JSON scan.

The `20260710120000_iroh_server_path_privacy` migration clears pre-policy broker
hints and removes existing Iroh route bodies from the legacy device registry.
Hosts republish sanitized EndpointID/managed-relay routes on their next refresh;
non-Iroh routes are preserved in order.

The `20260710113000_iroh_relay_reservation_expiry` migration added the expanded
status constraint with `NOT VALID` so its `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock was released
without scanning existing rows. The later
`20260718120000_iroh_relay_status_validation` migration validates it after the
schema change was recorded:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "iroh_relay_token_issuances"
  VALIDATE CONSTRAINT "iroh_relay_token_issuances_status_check";
```
