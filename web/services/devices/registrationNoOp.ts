/**
 * Whether a device registration would change anything the registry stores.
 *
 * The Mac re-registers whenever its advertised route set changes, and it
 * compares routes that still carry per-observation timestamps. Those
 * timestamps never reach the database: `sanitizeServerPublishedRoutes` strips
 * every iroh route down to its id, endpoint and priority. So a client can
 * re-POST a "changed" route set many times an hour while the row it would
 * write is byte-identical to the row already there.
 *
 * A client that cannot be updated will keep doing that. This lets the server
 * answer it without taking the per-team advisory lock or writing two rows.
 */

/**
 * How stale a presence timestamp may get before a no-op POST refreshes it.
 *
 * This interval is the registry's entire write budget. A device that keeps
 * re-POSTing an identical row writes at most once per interval, so the steady
 * write rate is `live devices / interval`. At one minute and ~2,900 live
 * devices that was ~53,000 `devices` upserts an hour in production, the single
 * hottest write in the database; five minutes brings the ceiling down by five.
 *
 * Five minutes is safe because nothing reads `last_seen_at` as a liveness
 * signal. Online/offline is owned by the presence service, which heartbeats
 * every 15 seconds over its own path; the registry timestamp only orders and
 * labels the device list a phone shows. Raising it further trades nothing but
 * the ordering of two Macs that were both active inside the same window, and
 * `CMUX_DEVICE_PRESENCE_TOUCH_INTERVAL_MS` retunes it without a deploy.
