// The Freestyle driver, on the public platform (api.freestyle.sh /v5, SDK
// freestyle@0.2.x). This is the only Freestyle arm: the legacy 0.1.x platform
// (SSH gateway, cmuxd-remote WebSocket PTY on 7777) has been removed,
// so every Freestyle machine now attaches the same way every other cmux Cloud
// machine does.
//
// Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon (transport `cmux-remote`,
// docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The API has
// no HTTP ingress proxy to arbitrary VM ports (TLS edge rules need a
// customer-verified domain), so the route addresses the daemon directly.
//
// Every machine joins the one VPC that belongs to its owner, and the owner's
// Mac joins the same VPC over a WireGuard tunnel, so the route is the VM's
// *private* address: `ws://[<vpc ipv6>]:1337/v1/link`. Nothing on that path is
// public — the machine opens no inbound port at all, and a caller with no
// tunnel up simply cannot reach it. Machines created before private networking
// (and any created while CMUX_VM_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ENABLED=0 rolls it back) keep
// the older posture: inbound 1337 open to the Internet and the route pointed at
// the stable public IPv6. Which posture a machine has is read from the machine
// itself, never from the flag, so a rollback cannot strand a machine that is
// already on a network.
//
// The daemon's Noise handshake encrypts and authenticates the session end to
// end either way (carrier TLS is not required and the route token only feeds
// the lease ledger). The daemon must bind dual-stack: the baked systemd unit
// sets CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337, which is also what makes a VPC
// address reachable, since it is neither loopback nor the public NIC. The
// driver never re-asserts it; a wrong bind is an image bug, fixed by a rebake.
//
// Creates take NO ports field, NO create-time env, and NO systemd injection;
// `firewall` is mandatory. The model-plane env is baked into the snapshot at
// /etc/cmux/model-plane.env (services/coderouter/vmGuestEnv.ts): the same
// bytes for every machine, so create writes nothing into the guest, and
// /etc/cmux/agent-config.sh sources it in every shell whatever user it runs as.
//
// Create runs no guest bootstrap. The devbox snapshot carries the pinned
// cmux-tui build, guest CLI integration, resource reporter, prompt sync, and
// cmux-tui-daemon systemd unit. Its supervisor starts the daemon with a fresh
// identity as soon as the machine resumes, keyed on the platform instance id.
// Create and trusted-carrier attach therefore use provider metadata and the
// immutable image contract, with no guest exec or filesystem upload.
//
// NO-WORK INVARIANT (read before adding a provider call to create, restore,
// resume, or openCmuxRemote). These paths are on the user's New Machine
// critical path, and every provider round trip here is paid on every create:
//   - create: one `vms.create` with VPC and TLS rules inline. No resize (each
//     size has its own snapshot), no `vm.exec`, no `vm.fs` write, no
//     readiness poll, no second provider read.
//   - restore/resume: no guest exec; the baked supervisor owns the daemon.
//   - openCmuxRemote: built from the row's providerMetadata alone. No guest
//     exec, no install, no "heal", no enrollment round trip.
// If the guest needs a new binary, file, hook, package, or setting, bake it
// into the devbox snapshot (web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts, the boot
// supervisor in services/vms/images/devbox/cmux-devbox-boot) and bump
// images/manifest.json. If it needs per-machine identity, derive it in the
// guest at boot from the platform instance id, or fetch it asynchronously
// from the guest (cmux-prompt-sync) without gating terminal access. Rows
// without `cmuxTuiContract: "snapshot-v2"` are refused; do not reintroduce
// create- or attach-time healing to support them. Running machines are
// brought onto the contract out of band instead (an in-place cmux-tui upgrade
// plus a guarded backfill): docs/cloud-guest-upgrades.md.
// Explicit user operations (`exec`, `resize`, file push/pull) are separate
// and stay. The one sanctioned guest exec around create is the prompt-name
// push in workflows.ts (schedulePromptIdentityPush): display-only, run after
// the response, never awaited by create. Do not add anything else to it.
// Attach has one opt-in counterpart: a machine with agentUpdates "latest"
// gets the coding-agent updater exec (scheduleGuestAgentUpdates in
// workflows.ts), also after the response and never awaited by attach.
//
// The coderouter model plane is edge-injected: the create carries an inline
// `tls` rule for the coderouter host whose transform overwrites `x-cmux-authorization` to every request the
// guest makes there. The platform steers the host to its edge (/etc/hosts) and
// installs its CA at boot; rules added after boot never reach a running
// guest, so the rule must be inline. The baked env file holds only base
// URLs and placeholder keys: no token is ever written into the guest, and
// create runs no exec and writes no file there (vms.create and a delete on
// rollback are its only provider calls). Injection
// becomes active 20-30 s after boot; the first agent request before that
// reaches the origin without the header and is rejected, then succeeds.
//
// The desktop and forwarded ports (`openPort`) travel the same private path
// as the daemon: the URL is the machine's VPC address, reachable only through
// the owner's tunnel, and the platform is never asked for a public ingress.
// The devbox desktop serves noVNC on 6901 with no VNC-level auth (the
// network is the gate, exactly as it is for the daemon port), so a machine
// that is not on a private network gets no desktop URL at all rather than a
// public one.
