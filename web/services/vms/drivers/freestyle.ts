// The Freestyle driver, on the public platform (api.freestyle.sh /v5, SDK
// freestyle@0.2.x). This is the only Freestyle arm: the legacy 0.1.x platform
// (SSH gateway, cmuxd-remote WebSocket PTY on 7777) has been removed,
// so every Freestyle machine now attaches the same way every other cmux Cloud
// machine does.
//
// Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon (transport `cmux-remote`,
// docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The API has
// no HTTP ingress proxy to arbitrary VM ports (TLS edge rules need a
// customer-verified domain), so the route addresses the daemon directly.
//
// Every machine joins the one VPC that belongs to its owner, and the owner's
// Mac joins the same VPC over a WireGuard tunnel, so the route is the VM's
// *private* address: `ws://[<vpc ipv6>]:1337/v1/link`. Nothing on that path is
// public — the machine opens no inbound port at all, and a caller with no
// tunnel up simply cannot reach it. Machines created before private networking
// (and any created while CMUX_VM_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ENABLED=0 rolls it back) keep
// the older posture: inbound 1337 open to the Internet and the route pointed at
// the stable public IPv6. Which posture a machine has is read from the machine
// itself, never from the flag, so a rollback cannot strand a machine that is
// already on a network.
//
// The daemon's Noise handshake encrypts and authenticates the session end to
// end either way (carrier TLS is not required and the route token only feeds
// the lease ledger). The daemon must bind dual-stack: the baked systemd unit
// sets CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337 and the driver re-asserts it on heal —
// which is also what makes a VPC address reachable, since it is neither
// loopback nor the public NIC.
//
// Creates take NO ports field, NO create-time env, and NO systemd injection;
// `firewall` is mandatory. The model-plane env is baked into the snapshot at
// /etc/cmux/model-plane.env (services/coderouter/vmGuestEnv.ts): the same
// bytes for every machine, so create writes nothing into the guest, and
// /etc/cmux/agent-config.sh sources it in every shell whatever user it runs as.
//
// Create runs no guest bootstrap. The devbox snapshot carries the pinned
// cmux-tui build and the cmux-tui-daemon systemd unit, and its supervisor
// (services/vms/images/devbox/cmux-devbox-boot) starts the daemon with a
// fresh identity as soon as the machine resumes, keyed on the platform
// instance id. Create is therefore `vms.create`, the grow-only resize, and one
// safe guest-adapter write; attach heals a daemon that is not yet, or no
// longer, listening.
//
// The coderouter model plane is edge-injected: the create carries an inline
// `tls` rule for the coderouter host whose transform overwrites `x-cmux-authorization` to every request the
// guest makes there. The platform steers the host to its edge (/etc/hosts) and
// installs its CA at boot; rules added after boot never reach a running
// guest, so the rule must be inline. The baked env file holds only base
// URLs and placeholder keys: no token is ever written into the guest, and
// create runs no exec and writes no file there (vms.create, the grow-only
// resize, and a delete on rollback are its only provider calls). Injection
// becomes active 20-30 s after boot; the first agent request before that
// reaches the origin without the header and is rejected, then succeeds.
//
// The desktop and forwarded ports (`openPort`) travel the same private path
// as the daemon: the URL is the machine's VPC address, reachable only through
// the owner's tunnel, and the platform is never asked for a public ingress.
// The devbox desktop serves noVNC on 6901 with no VNC-level auth (the
// network is the gate, exactly as it is for the daemon port), so a machine
// that is not on a private network gets no desktop URL at all rather than a
// public one.
