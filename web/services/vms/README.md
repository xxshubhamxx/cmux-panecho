# Cloud VMs service

Backend for `cmux vm new/ls/rm/exec/attach` and the sidebar Cloud VM surface. Stack Auth gates every public route. Provider API keys stay server-side. Every managed machine session uses the cmux-tui remote daemon (transport `cmux-remote`). The legacy `cmuxd-remote` WebSocket PTY is gone. Freestyle still exposes a scoped SSH proxy for provider-level diagnostics, but that unmanaged path does not carry cmux workspace, tab, or revision state.

## HTTP surface

- `/api/vm`, authenticated `GET` list and `POST` create.
- `/api/vm/:id`, authenticated `DELETE` destroy.
- `/api/vm/:id/exec`, authenticated `POST` command execution.
- `/api/vm/:id/attach-endpoint`, authenticated `POST` PTY/RPC attach lease minting.
- `/api/vm/tunnel`, authenticated `POST` WireGuard tunnel enrollment for the calling
  computer, `GET` tunnel/list state, `DELETE` unenrollment. Not Pro-gated: a lapsed
  subscription must still be able to reach machines it already owns.

There is no raw actor or provider protocol endpoint. The old `/api/rivet/*` gateway has been removed.

## Authentication model

Public callers only use `/api/vm/*`. Each route calls Stack Auth first and returns `401` before any Postgres or provider operation when the caller is unauthenticated.

Ownership checks load the VM under its immutable `owner_team_id`, validated
against the caller's current Stack team membership. The creator's user id and
billing attribution do not independently grant access. Personal machines use
the user's personal scope. Model credentials are further constrained by the
machine's coderouter pool; see `services/coderouter/README.md`.

Cookie-authenticated browser mutations also require a same-origin browser request. Native macOS
calls use `Authorization: Bearer` plus `X-Stack-Refresh-Token` and are not subject to browser CSRF.
For cookie calls, `POST`/`DELETE` routes reject cross-site `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` requests
before any VM workflow runs.

Cloud VM billing is team-scoped. The native client sends the selected Stack team in
`X-Cmux-Team-Id`; browser callers may send that header or `teamId`/`billingTeamId` in the request.
The backend validates membership before create or team-filtered list. If Stack returns one team,
the backend treats it as the personal team created on sign-up. If Stack returns no team, or multiple
teams without a selected/requested team, create fails before providers or billing are called.

The auth regression tests live in `web/tests/vm-route-auth.test.ts`. They verify unauthenticated create, list, destroy, attach, and exec requests return `401` before the VM workflow runs, and that cross-site cookie mutations are rejected.

## State model

- `cloud_vms` owns VM lifecycle state, provider ids, image ids, billing team/plan ids, and per-user idempotency keys.
- The Freestyle cmux-tui daemon owns the complete remote graph. The macOS
  catalog stores one lossless canonical fragment document plus typed projections
  and materialized ID / relationship indexes, never a second provider-specific
  graph. The document owns every known and unknown field. Typed and raw-row
  indexes are rebuilt at snapshot boundaries, updated transactionally by deltas,
  and omitted from encoded state because they are caches. Raw `id` and legacy
  agent `terminal_id` lookup is O(1) after the snapshot build, and duplicate
  identities fail closed. `rawSnapshot` is an export compatibility
  view, not a second store. A cursor `(generation, revision)` marks `journaled`
  state. A missing or null cursor marks `snapshot_only` legacy state.
- Mutation responses are read-your-write receipts. A journaled response carries
  `(generation, revision)`, and terminal creation carries the exact terminal,
  workspace, screen, pane, and tab path. The provider keeps that path as a
  transient overlay and exports it as `pending_writes` until an accepted graph
  reaches the receipt. The canonical document remains authoritative, and a
  generation change retires an old receipt. This is what makes create followed
  immediately by tab rename deterministic during event-feed lag.
- Snapshot-only state stays readable and agent-visible, but the client pauses
  event consumption and rejects revision-fenced workspace and tab renames until
  the daemon is upgraded. This preserves old VM visibility without claiming
  ordering that the old protocol cannot provide.
- Event-feed recovery is an explicit phase machine with a capped backoff. One
  accepted event starts a ten-second stability window; the retry budget resets
  only after that window or a new authenticated link. The first exhausted run
  gets one snapshot-recovery restart without erasing the spent budget. Later
  snapshot refreshes do not restart an exhausted feed.
- `cloud_vm_leases` stores hashed PTY/RPC/SSH lease tokens, provider identity handles, session ids, expiry, and revocation timestamps.
- `cmux-remote` lease rows are account-scoped and are marked revoked on sign-out.
  Freestyle daemon enrollment records are device-scoped and are not revoked yet,
  because the lease row does not store the claimed device id. The follow-up must
  persist that id and issue one exact `remote enroll revoke` command per device;
  revoking all devices would disconnect other team members.
- `cloud_vm_usage_events` records lifecycle, attach, SSH, and exec events with billing team/plan ids for billing and audit rollups.
- `cloud_vm_networks` records the one provider private network per (user, provider).
- `cloud_vm_tunnels` records each computer's WireGuard tunnel: provider tunnel id, device
  fingerprint, the client's **public** key, and its address inside the network. No private
  key is ever sent to or stored by the backend.
- `cloud_vm_tunnel_enrollment_locks` is the cross-instance mutation lease for one
  `(user_id, device_fingerprint)`. Despite the historical table name, it covers
  enrollment, read-with-attachment-heal, revoke, and account cleanup. The owner
  token fences release and renewal; a ten-minute expiry recovers crashed requests.
  Live contention returns `409 vm_tunnel_enrollment_busy`; a deployment missing
  the migration fails closed with `503 vm_tunnel_enrollment_unavailable`. Apply
  the migration before deploying code that calls `/api/vm/tunnel`.

Every create row gets a `slug`, a generated `adjective-color-animal` name (`sleepy-teal-otter`, `services/vms/vmNaming.ts`) picked inside the create transaction and never changed afterwards. It is unique among the team's live rows (`provisioning`, `running`, `paused`) via a partial unique index, so a destroyed or failed machine releases its name. Clients show it when no `display_name` is set; the provider VM id stays the machine's address. The same name is sent to the provider as its console label.

Create idempotency is enforced by the partial unique index on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`. A retry with the same key returns the existing VM after provisioning succeeds. A concurrent retry while the first create is still provisioning returns `409` instead of starting a second paid provider VM.

Active VM limits are enforced inside the same Postgres transaction that inserts the create row. The transaction takes a billing-team advisory lock before counting active VMs, so two concurrent creates for the same team cannot both pass the free-plan limit.

## Image manifest and rollback

Known-good images are recorded in `services/vms/images/manifest.json`. Each entry records the
provider, image id, cmux image version, build metadata (`repoCommit`, agent pins), and
validation status. **The manifest is the only source of truth for the image users get; no env
var selects or overrides it.**

Image policy:

- Clients request a machine **kind** (`kind: "desktop" | "base"` on `POST /api/vm`,
  `POST /api/vm/base/open`, and `POST /api/vm/base/reset`) rather than pinning an image id. With
  no `image`, the resolver serves the manifest entry flagged `kind` + `defaultForKind` at the
  plan's **size** (a body with neither `image` nor `kind` gets the **`desktop`** default,
  `VM_IMAGE_DEFAULT_KIND`: a machine with a screen is the product default and shell-only is
  always an explicit `kind: "base"`, #12239) and otherwise fails closed with
  `vm_image_config_error`. Sizes are Freestyle's ladder (`sm` … `2xl`,
  `services/vms/images/sizes.ts`): one snapshot per size, and the smallest whose memory covers
  the plan's `defaultMemoryMbForPlan` is served, so machines boot at their shape and the driver
  never resizes. Create responses and `limits.imageKinds` carry the `size`. `image` still wins when present, but a client-requested `image` must be
  in the manifest (or `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_UNMANIFESTED_IMAGES=1`, which local dev implies). Responses
  and `GET /api/vm` entries echo `kind`; `GET /api/vm` `limits.imageKinds` lists the kinds the
  default provider can serve and the image each resolves to.
- `vm_image_config_error` responses carry client-safe `details.imageRequested`, `details.kind`,
  `details.source` (`request` | `default`), and `details.allowedKinds`; the provider, manifest
  image ids, and reason go to the server log (`[vm-image-config-error]`) because API error
  payloads must not leak provider implementation details (see
  `expectNoCloudVmImplementationLeaks` in `tests/vm-route-auth.test.ts`).
- Local development and every deployed runtime serve the same `defaultForKind` entry; there is no
  separate local default and nothing to copy into `.env`.
- The current default ladders and their validation metadata are recorded in the authoritative
  [`images/manifest.json`](./images/manifest.json). Retired and rollback entries remain in that
  manifest for auditability; this README intentionally does not duplicate time-sensitive snapshot
  ids.
- Snapshots are account-scoped: a manifest id is only bootable by the Freestyle account whose
  `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` the deployment uses; promote under cmux's key.
- Promotion is `bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle` (bake → verify → manifest write), then a PR
  with the manifest diff; merging promotes. See
  `services/vms/images/devbox/README.md`. `tests/vm-image-manifest.test.ts` holds the invariants:
  one `defaultForKind` per provider and kind, unique versions, every default
  `validationStatus: "passed"`.
- Every devbox default is the **desktop** image and **one snapshot ladder serves both kinds**: the
  manifest lists each snapshot once as the `desktop` default and once as the `base` default (the
  `-base` rows point at the same ids), so `kind` never changes what a machine is. Every machine has
  the shell tooling, the coding agents, TigerVNC on `:1` with an openbox session, the tint2 dock
  (Chrome, Files, Ghostty), the CC0 wallpaper, the accessibility bus for computer-use, and noVNC on
  6901, run by the `cmux-desktop` unit; the contract lives in `services/vms/images/desktop.ts`. The
  app's New Machine sheet asks only for a size, `cmux vm new` accepts `--desktop` / `--base` for
  older scripts without changing anything, and the Mac app lists a Displays row for every
  newly created default machine. Historical shell-only machines keep their existing capabilities. A shell-only base ladder can still be baked (`--no-desktop`) but is not promoted.
  `POST /api/vm/[id]/open-port` (the app's Displays row, `cmux
  vm open <m>:desktop`, port rows) returns the machine's **private VPC address**
  (`http://10.x.x.x:6901/vnc.html?…`), reachable only over the owner's WireGuard tunnel, the same
  path the daemon route takes; the driver (re)starts the `cmux-desktop` unit first when noVNC is
  not listening. noVNC has no auth of its own, so a machine outside a private network (created
  before private networking) gets an error rather than a public URL.
- Baked agent tools are installed at image-build time. They are not auto-updated on VM startup, so
  startup latency stays bounded and the manifest remains the source of truth.
- To update tool versions, run `bun run devbox:pins:check --write` (web/; it rewrites the Dockerfile
  ARG pins to the npm registry's current releases and refuses ranges and tags), bump
  `CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH`, then promote both ladders. `tests/vm-image-manifest.test.ts` and
  `devbox:manifest:check` fail while a default is baked at another epoch or from other devbox
  sources than the checkout (`devboxSourceDriftProblems`), so a pin bump and its promotion land
  in one PR and never drift apart. `CMUX_CLOUD_IMAGE_<TOOL>_NPM_SPEC` overrides must be exact npm
  package version pins, for example `@openai/codex@0.130.0`, or `none` to disable a tool. The
  image builder rejects ranges and tags such as `latest`.

A leftover `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` in a deployment is ignored; the env audit reports it as
stale configuration to remove.

Rollback is a manifest change:

1. Revert the promotion PR as a whole (entries are never removed). Flipping `defaultForKind` back
   to a previous `validationStatus: "passed"` entry by hand also means reverting the Dockerfile
   epoch and pins that entry was baked from, or `devbox:manifest:check` and the manifest test fail
   on the epoch and source-digest invariants.
2. Deploy staging, smoke test, then production.
3. Keep old snapshots until all VMs using them are gone.

## Baked tools and VM-local cmux CLI

The Freestyle devbox image is defined in
`web/services/vms/images/devbox/` and baked with `web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts`
(chatmux devbox
parity: devtools, mise node/python/bun, uv, gh, Chrome + cua-driver, pinned coding
agents, ble.sh devshell, agent-config generator). The session daemon is cmux-tui,
baked at `/root/.cmux/bin/cmux-tui` from the files.cmux.com artifacts manifest pin
current at bake time (recorded as `cmuxTuiCommit` in the manifest entry). Its identity
is bound to the machine's instance id by `cmux-devbox-boot`, so create runs no guest
bootstrap. See the devbox README for the bake + verify + manifest flow. The legacy cmuxd-remote image builder
(`build-cloud-vm-images.ts`) has been deleted; images it produced remain in the
manifest for reference but cannot serve the cmux-remote transport.

## Browser automation from a Cloud VM remote session

`cmux browser ...` inside a `cmux ssh` or `cmux vm ssh` session controls the local cmux browser
through the authenticated relay. It does not start Chrome inside the VM. This keeps browser UI,
cookies, profiles, and screenshots on the local Mac while agent computation runs remotely.

The Linux relay CLI supports the common browser automation subcommands: `open`, `navigate`, `back`,
`forward`, `reload`, `get-url`, `snapshot`, `eval`, `wait`, `click`, `dblclick`, `hover`, `focus`,
`check`, `uncheck`, `fill`, `type`, `press`, `select`, and `screenshot`. Existing-browser commands
default to `CMUX_SURFACE_ID`; `open` defaults to `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`.

## Cloud VM session lifecycle

`cmux vm ssh <id>` and `cmux vm attach <id>` open a cmux-managed remote workspace. On Freestyle,
`vm ssh` is a compatibility alias for the `cmux-remote` daemon path. Freestyle's scoped SSH proxy
(`beta-ssh.freestyle.sh`) is intentionally not used for managed sessions, because raw SSH cannot
carry the daemon graph or revision fence. `cmux vm ssh-info <id>` remains a legacy print-only
command and is unsupported by the managed API.

Plain `cmux ssh` uses OpenSSH control sockets and `ControlPersist` by default. Cloud VM Freestyle
sessions use the cmux-tui daemon and its reconnecting Noise link, not OpenSSH. If a legacy provider
returns SSH attach info, the shared wrapper still retries after sleep or a network transition;
Freestyle never enters that branch and never falls back silently to a local shell.

Manual sleep/network smoke:

1. Start a Cloud VM, then attach with `cmux vm ssh <id>`.
2. Confirm the terminal reaches a remote prompt and the sidebar shows the workspace as connected.
3. Disable Wi-Fi or sleep the Mac long enough for OpenSSH to exit.
4. Restore the network and confirm the terminal prints a reconnect attempt and either lands back in
   a remote prompt or clearly reports that the remote session ended.
5. Confirm the sidebar shows `Reconnecting` during retry and `Connected` after recovery.

## Effect conventions

Routes stay thin. They parse HTTP input, set span attributes, and run an Effect workflow.

`workflows.ts` composes explicit services:

- `VmRepository`, Postgres reads and writes.
- `VmProviderGateway`, provider SDK calls wrapped in typed Effect errors.

Provider SDKs remain Promise-based adapters under `drivers/`, but all route-visible backend logic is modeled as Effect values with typed errors and explicit dependencies.

## Deployment

Vercel runs the Next.js application and all VM REST routes. Postgres is the persistent control plane. There is no Rivet deployment for this feature.

Production and staging use PlanetScale PostgreSQL. The Vercel runtime and explicit migration jobs use the PlanetScale connection URL.

Set these Vercel environment variables per production/staging environment:

- `CMUX_DB_DRIVER=url`.
- `DATABASE_URL`, a PlanetScale PostgreSQL connection URL. Keep it in the Vercel project secret store.
- `CMUX_DB_POOL_MAX`, small pool size for Vercel Functions. Start with `5`.
- Preserve `sslmode=verify-full` on the PlanetScale URL.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED`, global create kill switch. Set `0` to block new paid creates while
  keeping list, attach, and delete available.
- `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING`, explicit opt-out of the paid-plan Cloud VM gate. Leave unset
  (or set to `0`) in every shared environment; set to `1` only for a deliberate demo/rollback. When
  enabled, `CMUX_VM_FREE_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS` and the plan-specific free limit are honored again.
- `CMUX_VM_REQUIRE_PRO`, legacy compatibility spelling for the paid-plan gate. Unset now means the
  gate is **on**. `0`/`false`/`off` is treated as the old permissive escape hatch only when
  `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING` is absent; prefer the clearly named allow switch for new
  deployments.
- `CMUX_VM_FREESTYLE_ENABLED`, per-provider Freestyle create kill switch.
- `CMUX_CODEROUTER_EDGE_ORIGIN`, optional bare https origin guests dial for coderouter
  (default `https://coderouter.dev`); set it on a preview deployment to test against that
  deployment. See "Model plane".
- `CMUX_VM_CODEROUTER_ENV_ENABLED`, local-dev only. `0` creates unwired machines with no
  coderouter env or edge rule. Never set it in production or staging.
- `CMUX_VM_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ENABLED`, fail-closed private networking switch. Unset/`1`:
  Freestyle machines join their owner's VPC and open no public inbound port. `0`: new
  machine creation and tunnel enrollment stop. The switch never selects public ingress.
- `CMUX_VM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, optional comma-separated extra origins allowed for cookie mutations.
- `FREESTYLE_API_KEY`, the normal Freestyle provider credential. A complete
  `FREESTYLE_STACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` plus `FREESTYLE_TEAM_ID` pair is the supported
  short-lived alternative.
- `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, only `freestyle` (and its default).
- `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PLAN`, optional fallback for accounts without plan metadata. It defaults to `free`;
  paid values are ignored unless `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING=1`, so deployment configuration
  cannot silently grant every unclassified account a paid entitlement.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID`, optional Stack Auth team item used as the free-plan create-credit bucket. Leave unset to skip free-plan create-credit accounting; set to `none`, `disabled`, `off`, or `false` to explicitly opt out.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_COST`, optional free-plan per-create cost. Defaults to `1`.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_INITIAL_CREATE_CREDITS`, optional first-use seed for the free-plan Stack Auth create-credit item. Defaults to `20`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID`, optional global Stack Auth item used as a prepaid create-credit bucket for every plan without a plan-specific item. Set to `none`, `disabled`, `off`, or `false` to opt out of create credits for plans without a plan-specific value.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST`, default `1`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST_FREESTYLE`, optional provider-specific override.
- `CMUX_VM_FREE_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, default `0` and ignored while the paid-plan gate is enforced.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, optional incident-only cap for one paid plan. Unset means
  paid plans have no active-machine limit.
- Stack Auth environment variables.
- Axiom/OpenTelemetry exporter variables.

Local development keeps using Docker Postgres through `DATABASE_URL`, derived from `CMUX_PORT`.

Use `bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- staging --check` to verify access without changing schema. Operator jobs use the branch's direct port (5432) and verify its TLS certificate. `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` takes precedence when set. With process-provided credentials, set `CMUX_CLOUD_VM_ENV_SOURCE=process`; otherwise the command pulls the selected Vercel project.

Run production/staging migrations explicitly, never during Vercel build or route startup. The local operator path pulls the selected Vercel project `DATABASE_URL`. The GitHub Actions path reads the protected `DATABASE_URL` secret and applies Drizzle migrations:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- staging
bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- production
```

For local Docker Postgres, keep using:

```bash
bun db:migrate
```

Before a staging or production migration, run the preflight:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:preflight -- --schema-only .
```

Audit deployed env names without printing values:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- staging --strict
bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- production --strict
```

This audit is a local operator command. It intentionally does not run in GitHub Actions because
reading all Vercel env values from Actions would require a broad Vercel env-read token.

Smoke deployed API auth/list behavior without creating production VMs:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- staging
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- production
```

Staging may run a real create/destroy smoke with tiny quotas:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- staging --create --provider freestyle
```

Run default-provider stress before changing provider defaults or after provider incidents:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:stress -- staging --count 8 --concurrency 4 --provider default
bun run cloud-vm:stress -- production --count 12 --concurrency 4 --provider default
```

## Startup benchmarks

`docs/cloud-startup-latency.md` records where Cloud machine startup time goes and the
lower-bound budget (issue #12905). The three benchmarks it is built on live beside the smoke
scripts and only ever create, measure and delete their own resources:

```bash
cd web
bun scripts/cloud-vm/bench-vm-startup.mjs staging --trials 5        # create → attach → exec → pause → resume → destroy, with the create route's Server-Timing stages
bun scripts/cloud-vm/bench-freestyle-floor.ts --trials 5 --burst 3  # provider floor with the SDK: allocation, daemon listening, exec RTT, guest shell, pause/start
bun scripts/cloud-vm/bench-private-link.ts --trials 3               # the app's transport path headlessly: driver create, attach bundle, WireGuard hub, link, prompt
```

The two SDK benchmarks read the provider credential the way the runtime does
(`FREESTYLE_API_KEY`, or `FREESTYLE_STACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` with `FREESTYLE_TEAM_ID`,
from `~/.secrets/cmux.env`). The API benchmark pulls the target's Vercel env, fills
a sensitive (empty) value from the process environment, and sends its throwaway
session only to the project's own https origin; a deployment that Vercel's API
attributes to the project also needs `--allow-preview`, and any other https host
`--allow-any-url`.

## Telemetry

Every `/api/vm*` request runs inside `withAuthedVmApiRoute` (`routeHelpers.ts`), which owns one request context (`requestContext.ts`) and one route span. The client mints a W3C `traceparent` and an `X-Cmux-Client-Request-Id` per call and sends `X-Cmux-Client`, `X-Cmux-App-Version`, `X-Cmux-App-Build`, `X-Cmux-Channel`. The server answers every response with `x-cmux-trace-id` and `x-cmux-span-id`, and every error body carries `traceId` (also `ui.traceId`). The Mac app prints it as `Reference: <trace id>` on every Cloud VM error, and the socket `vm_error` payload carries it as `data.trace_id`. That id is the join key across the three sinks:

- Axiom (`cmux-prod-otel-traces`, 100% of VM traces): route span with `cmux.vm.timing.<stage>_ms`, `cmux.vm.request_duration_ms`, `cmux.vm.request_success`, `cmux.vm.error_*` (code, phase, provider, image, env var, reason), `cmux.client.*`, `cmux.user_id`, `cmux.vercel.request_id`; provider spans under it record the wrapped cause chain (`cmux.error_cause_chain`, `cmux.error_cause_http_status`, `cmux.error_cause_code`). Error and non-polled responses force a bounded span flush in `after()` so an error-heavy instance cannot drop the trace.
- PostHog (production, or `CMUX_VM_ANALYTICS_FORCE=1`): `cloud_vm_request` (schema 2) for every failure and for the successes a user waits on (create, attach, base open, restore, fork, ...) with `duration_ms`, `status`, `error_code`, `error_phase`, `operator_fault`, `trace_id`, `client_*`, plus the provider `vm_id` from the URL, `plan_id`, `billing_customer_type`, `billing_team_id` and the `stack_team` group; polled reads (`list`, `status`, `stats`, `list_sessions`, `get_tunnel`, `approve_cmux_remote_enrollment`) succeed silently. Every failure also emits a `$exception` (Error Tracking) fingerprinted by error code. `cloud_vm_provision` (schema 3, failures of create-like operations, feeds the alert) carries the same scope plus `trace_id`, `duration_ms`, `error_phase` and client fields.
- PostHog product events (production, or `CMUX_SERVER_ANALYTICS_FORCE=1`): every allowlisted `cloud_vm_usage_events` ledger row is mirrored after a successful Postgres insert by `productAnalytics.ts` as `cloud_vm_created`, `cloud_vm_destroyed`, `cloud_vm_attached`, `cloud_vm_exec`, `cloud_vm_forked`, `cloud_vm_resumed`, `cloud_vm_snapshot_created`, `cloud_vm_port_opened`, `cloud_vm_base_opened`, `cloud_vm_base_reset`, keyed by the Stack user id with the billing team as the `stack_team` group and `billing_plan` on the person. Their `vm_id` is the internal `cloud_vms.id` UUID, not the provider id in request telemetry. Catalog, identity model and query shapes: `docs/posthog/cloud-product-analytics.md`.
- Sentry (shared project, `subsystem: cloud_vm_api`): every VM error, `error` level for operator faults and `warning` for user faults, fingerprint `["cmux-vm-error", code, provider]`, tags `vm.error_code`, `vm.phase`, `vm.operation`, `vm.provider`, `client.*`, `trace_id`, and a trace context holding the same ids.

Client side, `VMClientTelemetry` (`Sources/Cloud/VMClientTelemetry.swift`) measures every request: `os.log` category `CloudVM` for all of them, a Sentry breadcrumb for all, PostHog `cmux_cloud_vm_request` for failures plus non-polled successes, and a Sentry event for failures (5xx and transport failures `error`, 4xx `warning`). Client failures are throttled per operation and code (60 s PostHog, 300 s Sentry) so a polling loop during an outage produces one event per window.

Every outbound call (Freestyle, Stack Auth, Stripe, PostHog, Slack, Postgres, ...) is a client span inside the request trace, so the Axiom trace view shows the waterfall of third-party calls under each route span. `DependencySpanProcessor` (`services/observability/dependencies.ts`) stamps `cmux.dep.name` (third party) and `cmux.dep.route` (method plus id-templated path, `POST /v5/vms/{id}/exec-await`) on each of them at start. Failure rate and latency per dependency and endpoint, VM traces at 100%, everything else sampled at the base ratio:

```
['cmux-prod-otel-traces']
| where _time > ago(1h) and isnotempty(['attributes.custom']['cmux.dep.name'])
| extend status = toint(coalesce(['attributes.custom']['http.status_code'], ['attributes.custom']['http.response.status_code']))
| summarize calls = count(), failures = countif(status >= 400 or isnotempty(error)),
            p50_ms = round(percentile(duration, 50) / 1000000, 0), p95_ms = round(percentile(duration, 95) / 1000000, 0)
  by dep = tostring(['attributes.custom']['cmux.dep.name']), route = tostring(['attributes.custom']['cmux.dep.route'])
| extend failure_rate = round(100.0 * failures / calls, 2)
| order by failures desc, calls desc

Freestyle only, per endpoint over time: add `| where dep == 'freestyle'` and `bin(_time, 5m)` to the `by` clause. Sentry's NodeFetch integration is disabled in `instrumentation.ts` because it duplicated every fetch span as a bare `GET`/`POST` client span without a URL.

To investigate one failure: take the reference id, query Axiom `['cmux-prod-otel-traces'] | where trace_id == '<id>'`, open the PostHog `$exception` or `cloud_vm_request` row with `trace_id = <id>`, and search Sentry for `trace_id:<id>`.

## GitHub operations

Cloud VM migrations and smoke checks are exposed as manual GitHub Actions:

- `Cloud VM DB migration`
- `Cloud VM smoke`

They use these GitHub Environments:

- `cloud-vm-staging`
- `cloud-vm-production`

Each environment needs:

- secret `DATABASE_URL` for the target branch
- variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- secret `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` for smoke workflows

Production migration runs staging migration first on the same commit, then waits on the protected production environment approval.

## Local database development

Use `CMUX_PORT` to run multiple isolated web and database environments on one machine:

```bash
CMUX_PORT=10180 bun dev
```

`bun dev` sources provider values from `~/.secrets/cmux.env`, then sources
`~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env` (falling back to the legacy secret files). It derives the local
database URL from `CMUX_PORT`, starts this worktree's Docker Postgres, applies Drizzle migrations,
then starts Next.js. When it exits or is interrupted, it stops the matching Docker container and
network while preserving the Postgres volume.

The dev Postgres port is `CMUX_PORT + 10000`, so `CMUX_PORT=10180` maps to `localhost:20180`. `bun db:test` starts a separate test DB on `CMUX_PORT + 30000`, applies migrations twice, and runs behavior tests against a real Postgres container.

## Provider matrix

| Verb | Freestyle |
| --- | --- |
| `cmux vm new` | yes |
| `cmux vm new --workspace` | yes |
| `cmux vm new --detach` | yes |
| `cmux vm attach <id>` | yes |
| `cmux vm ssh <id>` | yes (cmux-remote alias) |
| `cmux vm ssh-info <id>` | no (managed API has no SSH credential endpoint) |
| `cmux vm exec <id> -- ...` | yes |
| `cmux vm ls / rm` | yes |
| snapshot / restore | yes |

`cmux vm ssh <id>` is the user-facing interactive alias and opens the same managed workspace path
as `cmux vm attach <id>`. Freestyle's provider SSH proxy is available outside cmux's managed
session protocol, but the managed API does not mint or expose its scoped identities. This keeps
workspace, tab, terminal, and revision state on one authoritative cmux-tui path. Therefore
`cmux vm ssh-info <id>` and `POST /api/vm/:id/ssh-endpoint` stay unsupported.

## Capabilities: the client-visible provider contract

Every VM API response (`GET /api/vm` entries, `GET /api/vm/:id`, create, restore, fork, base
open/reset) carries a `capabilities` object — `{snapshot, restore, fork, exec, stats, ports,
desktop, sizing, persistentHome, attachTransports}` — derived in
`services/vms/drivers/index.ts` (`vmCapabilitiesOf`) from driver method presence, with the
driver's declared `capabilities` overriding. Flags with no structural signal (`desktop`,
`sizing`, `persistentHome`) default to false: a driver opts in to what it honors, and
`POST /api/vm` rejects a `memoryMb` request the resolved provider would silently drop, and
ignores `persistentHome`/`perMachineHome` on a provider without home volumes (shipped CLIs
send them on every default create; a Freestyle machine is durable without a volume), noting
the dropped fields on the span. Clients (the Mac app and CLI) gate verbs on this object and never on a
provider name, so a new provider registered in `drivers/index.ts` works end to end with no
client update. `openAttach`/`openSSH`/`revokeSSHIdentity` are optional interface members;
the gateway maps an absent method to `VmOperationUnsupportedError` (an honest 501).
`MockVMProvider` (`drivers/mock.ts`) is the interface's second implementer and the test
double for provider-contract tests.

## TLS edge: port previews and credential injection

The current port-preview and model-plane paths have different trust boundaries:

- **Port previews (`openPort`, capability `ports: true`)** use the machine's private
  network address over the owner's WireGuard tunnel. Opening a port does not mint
  a public bearer URL or TLS rule. `revokeEndpointLeases` only cleans up legacy,
  driver-owned preview rules; separately published services have their own lifecycle.
  Revoking network access is not a promise to erase content already cached by a browser.
- **Model-plane edge injection** — an egress rule `{ vmId } → { public }` on the
  CodeRouter origin with a headers transform. The edge overwrites the guest's
  placeholder `authorization` and injects one signed `x-cmux-authorization`
  header in flight. The persisted env file carries only
  placeholder keys, and a compromised guest has no credential to exfiltrate. Header
  values are write-only at the provider (read back as `***`); provisioning fails
  closed if the rule cannot be installed.

## In-VM cmux CLI and machine-to-machine links

The driver installs `/usr/local/bin/cmux`, `coderouter`, and `cr` as aliases of
one Rust facade (`cmux-tui/crates/cmux-cloud-cli`). The facade forwards the complete
CodeRouter argument list to the official Rust core and local/peer commands to the
guest adapter, which uses the machine's cmux-tui daemon. `cmux coderouter` and
`cmux cr` use the same CodeRouter implementation as the top-level aliases.

The facade and CodeRouter core are one checksum-pinned archive described by
`guestCliDistribution.json`. Create and attach heal this distribution separately
from the persistent terminal daemon, so a CLI upgrade does not restart terminals.
Downloads must match the archive and executable checksums before aliases change.
The adapter at `/usr/local/libexec/cmux-cloud-adapter` retains the existing cmux
session grammar and Cloud extensions (`status`, `machines`, `models`, and `agent`).
`usage` uses the official CodeRouter account/quota view; `machines` retains the
VM spend view.

CodeRouter loads the baked TLS origin without reading or writing a user login.
Requests carry only the placeholder; the provider's outbound TLS rule injects
the VM identity. The backend derives its team and pool from that identity.
`add`, `remove`, and Claude account mutations use the same scope, including SQL
checks on deletion and pool grants during import. VM imports are team-visible;
private imports and credentials outside the assigned pool remain inaccessible.
Login, logout, team switching, and cross-team transfers are unavailable in Cloud.
`org current` and `org list` display only the VM's fixed team.

The initial integration pin is a development artifact from the official
CodeRouter source, with source commits, test runs, and checksums recorded in the
manifest. The standalone npm release continues to use that same source core.

Freestyle machines boot the shared devbox snapshot (definition in
`services/vms/images/devbox/`, baked with `web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts` against
the public platform `api.freestyle.sh`): chatmux-devbox tool parity (mise node/python/bun,
uv, gh, devtools, pinned coding agents, ble.sh, half-life prompt, seeded history). Machines
run no cmuxd-remote: the **cmux-tui remote daemon is the machine's only session daemon**,
and the bake installs the pinned static-musl build at `/root/.cmux/bin/cmux-tui` with
`sha256sum -c` verification. A create is one `vms.create` (firewall, VPC, and the coderouter
TLS rule inline); a size-less image also gets the grow-only resize. Nothing is written into
the guest: the model-plane env is baked (see "Model plane"). The baked supervisor starts the
daemon with a fresh identity
within a second of resume (the snapshot is a memory image, so the identity is keyed on
the platform instance id). Attach heals a daemon that is not listening, reinstalling only
when the binary is missing or behind the manifest pin. The daemon runs as root with
`HOME=/root`; the build and its digest come from the artifacts manifest published by
`.github/workflows/cmux-tui-artifacts.yml`, nothing is pinned by hand, and a new pin
reaches new machines through a rebake. Config: `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` (or `FREESTYLE_STACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` +
`FREESTYLE_TEAM_ID`); optionally `FREESTYLE_API_URL` to point
at a non-default edge and `CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL` to pin a deployment to one
commit's `https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui/<commit>/manifest.json` instead of the rolling
`latest`.

Cloud-created Freestyle machines explicitly set `idleTimeoutSeconds: -1`, making them
persistent boxes rather than provider-idle workers. A user-open operation probes the live
provider state even when the control-plane row still says `running`, resumes a paused/stopped
machine, and only then mints its attach or port endpoint. Machines created before this policy
are migrated when they are resumed: any finite legacy idle timeout is cleared best-effort.

There is no HTTP ingress proxy to arbitrary VM ports on the public platform (a TLS edge rule
needs a customer-verified domain), so the daemon is reached directly at a VM address.

**Private networking is the default.** Every Freestyle machine joins the one VPC that
belongs to its owner (provisioned on first create, slug `cmux-net-<hash>`); the owner's
computers join the same VPC over WireGuard tunnels (`/api/vm/tunnel`). The app starts a
user-space WireGuard hub for terminal and metadata traffic. The Network Extension starts
only when a browser or webview needs the private network. The
route is then the VM's *private* address — `ws://[<vpc ipv6>]:1337/v1/link` — and creates
state outbound-only firewall rules: no public inbound port at all. The VPC's single
members-reach-each-other rule is what admits the owner's other machines and tunnels to the
daemon port. A machine with no private address fails closed. The daemon binds dual-stack
(`[::]:1337`), re-asserted on every attach-time heal, which is also what makes the VPC
address reachable.
The Noise handshake encrypts and authenticates the session end to end, so carrier TLS is not
required; the route token exists only for the lease ledger. Creates take no ports field and
no create-time env; the guest's model-plane env is the same for every machine and baked at
`/etc/cmux/model-plane.env`, which `/etc/cmux/agent-config.sh` sources when no boot env and no
per-home file exist. It carries alias base URLs and a placeholder key only; the credential is
edge-injected (see "Model plane" below).

Every guest command is run with `linuxUser: "root"`. The 0.2 API's default is *not* root but
"the account holding uid 1000, or root in an image with no such account", and the devbox image
ships a uid-1000 user — leaving it unset would silently move the daemon and its install off
the root layout they are baked around.

`POST /api/vm/[id]/attach-endpoint` with
`{"transport":"cmux-remote","clientCapabilities":[...]}` returns
`{route, token, session, trustedCarrier, daemonBuild?}`. The machine's daemon serves a
trusted-carrier listener: the route is reachable only inside the owner's private network,
whose members are all the owner's, so the daemon grants every link carrier
authentication and the client connects with `cmux-tui remote connect <route> --carrier`
through the user-space WireGuard hub — no device enrollment, no invitation, no approval.
The endpoint brings a daemon from an older bake to the pinned build and restarts it with
the trusted drop-in, except under a device that is already enrolled there (its sessions
would end); that device keeps dialing with its stored key. `POST
/api/vm/[id]/cmux-remote/approve` remains as a no-op that answers `approved` for older
Mac builds. The legacy websocket/SSH attach (`attach-endpoint` without a
transport, `POST /api/vm/[id]/sessions`) answers `409 vm_attach_transport_unsupported` with
`details.supportedTransports: ["cmux-remote"]`. `cmux vm shell`, `cmux vm new`,
`cmux vm base open` and the Machines panel all drive this from the Mac.
See docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md for the design.

Freestyle machines run the cmux-tui daemon and only the `cmux-remote`
transport. The route is the VM's private VPC address. The app carries it through
user-space WireGuard. The daemon's Noise enrollment gates sessions. The backend writes
only a hash of attach tokens to Postgres; raw tokens are returned once to the Mac client.
Machines created by the old cmuxd-remote drivers need recreation on the private network.

Operational note: before rollout, verify the deployed provider, create switch,
image manifest, and credential presence with
`bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- <target> --strict`. The audit reads Vercel
metadata for Sensitive variables and never exposes their values. Credential
presence is not credential validity, so confirm create, attach, and daemon
health with `bun run cloud-vm:stress -- <target> --provider default`.

## Model plane

No coderouter secret ever lands in a guest. `createVm`/`restoreVm` take a `modelPlane`
provisioner (`services/vms/modelPlaneGateway.ts` adapting
`services/coderouter/vmModelPlane.ts`). After the `cloud_vms` row exists and before the
provider call, it mints one signed authorization token bound to the row id (`coderouter_route_tokens.vm_id`)
and returns one edge rule: domain `coderouter.cmux.internal` (the alias every guest dials;
`CMUX_VM_EDGE_ALIAS_DOMAIN` overrides it per deployment, never per machine), destination host
this deployment's API host, and header `x-cmux-authorization`. The
Freestyle driver passes the rule inline as `tls.rules` on the create; the platform resolves the
alias to its edge, installs its CA in the guest at boot, terminates TLS for the alias, forwards
to the destination host, and injects (and overwrites) those headers on every request.
coderouter rejects a bound token whose request carries a different VM id. Rules created after
boot never reach a running guest, so the rule is never added later.

Because the guest always dials the alias, its env is identical everywhere and is baked
(`services/coderouter/vmGuestEnv.ts`, written by the bake to `/etc/cmux/model-plane.env`):
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `CMUX_CODEROUTER_URL` on the alias origin and the
placeholder `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `CMUX_CODEROUTER_EDGE_ORIGIN` (a bare https
origin) only moves the rule's destination, for a preview deployment. Injection activates a few
seconds after boot; nothing waits for it. Node harnesses (Claude Code, pi) need
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, which `agent-config.sh` exports when the platform CA file exists.

Provisioning is mandatory: a coderouter outage fails the create with
`vm_model_plane_unavailable` (503, retryable), refunds the create credit, marks the row failed
with `model_plane_unavailable` (same-key retries reach provisioning again), and creates no
provider machine. There is no coderouter plan or entitlement gate on the model plane: access to
coderouter and Subrouter is team membership only, so every member of the billing team gets a
token. Rows written by the retired gate still carry `model_plane_entitlement` and stay
retryable. Tokens never rotate; `destroyVm`, account deletion,
the status reconcile cron, and every create rollback revoke them best-effort.
`CMUX_VM_CODEROUTER_ENV_ENABLED=0` is a local-dev escape hatch only: it creates an unwired
machine (no env, no rule, still no secret) and must never be set in production.

## Usage, limits, and pricing

The usage ledger is in Postgres. VM create pricing gates can use Stack Auth payment items, but free-plan create credits are opt-in. Configure `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` only when the free plan should consume a prepaid create-credit bucket. When enabled, the create workflow records a one-time local grant row, seeds the configured Stack Auth item credits once per billing team, reserves one create credit only for a newly inserted row, calls the provider, and refunds the credit if provisioning fails before a usable VM exists.

Plan limits are team-based. Stack Auth personal teams should stay enabled for both dev/staging and production projects (`createTeamOnSignUp` / `teams.createPersonalTeamOnSignUp`). New VM rows store `billing_team_id` and `billing_plan_id`; the free plan allows zero active VMs by default and remains at zero regardless of stale free-limit env values while the paid-plan gate is on. A deliberate `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING=1` escape hatch re-enables the configured free allowance for local demos or a controlled rollback; Go is a $10/month personal starter plan with one active 2 vCPU / 4 GiB / 16 GB VM and two saved VM records. It includes 40 VM-hours per Stripe billing period. PostgreSQL runtime records commit with VM state changes, and an account-level lock limits Go to two retained VMs in total, with one active. Freestyle lifetime runtime caps enforce the remaining allowance and block restarts until cmux grants a new allowance. A minute job reconciles exhausted machines. Go disk growth beyond 16 GiB is refused; Pro and Max get the allowance sold on /pricing, 50 active machines per billing team, multiplied by the Team subscription's paid seats (`cmuxSeats` in the team's Stack metadata, written from the Stripe quantity) so "50 per paid seat" holds for the whole team (`PAID_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS_DEFAULT`; `maxActiveVms` in entitlements and the list response). New machines use validated Freestyle base snapshots from 4 GiB RAM / 16 GB disk through 64 GiB RAM / 128 GB disk, including the 24 GiB / 96 GB intermediate size. The default is 8 GiB RAM and 32 GB disk. Free, Pro, Team, and Founder's plans may start machines up to 24 GiB; the 32 GiB and 64 GiB sizes require the Max plan (`maxMemoryMbForPlan`, `lockedMemoryOptionsMbForPlan`). The list response names the locked sizes and the upgrade plan, and a create with a locked size returns `402 vm_memory_requires_plan` rather than coercing to a smaller machine. Each machine has its own CPU, memory, and disk. The repository enforces only the machine-count allowance under the billing-team lock; resource metadata supports per-machine fork, snapshot, and resize recovery. Disk growth is independent, grow-only, and capped at 256 GiB in 4 GiB steps. The Freestyle driver applies the default at create (`CMUX_VM_DISK_MB` overrides it), and the resize API reads provider stats before and after the provider confirms the change. Destroyed VMs do not count against a limit; pausing frees the active slot, while Go still counts the retained VM toward its saved limit. Paid plan activation should write a readable plan id such as `pro` into Stack Auth team read-only metadata (`cmuxVmPlan`) or equivalent billing sync metadata. Paid-plan `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, `CMUX_VM_PAID_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, and `CMUX_VM_SHARED_CPU_LIMIT_ENABLED` are retired and ignored. The paid allowance lives in code; `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED=0` remains the provisioning incident control. Paid plans only consume Stack Auth create credits when `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` or the global `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` is configured.

### The free limit is the paywall moment

`vmActiveLimitExceededResponse` (routeHelpers) renders every provisioning verb's over-limit error. On unpaid plans the message sells the upgrade — with the default zero allowance it is the subscribe gate ("Cloud VMs require a cmux Pro subscription") with `upgradeRequired: true` and `upgradeUrl` pointing at `/pricing` — so clients can show a real upgrade prompt (checkout flow per `skills/cmux-billing`) instead of a dead error. Paid plans see it at the plan allowance (50 active machines, times paid seats on Team) or at an operator incident brake; then the message is operational "delete one" guidance, not a paywall.

### Pricing is flat

Go includes one active VM with the starter resource shape. Pro and Max include up to 50 active VMs (per paid seat on Team) for a flat subscription price, with independent CPU, memory, and disk for each VM. Go is capped by active VM count until usage metering is added. There is no overage billing; an earlier GB-RAM-awake-seconds metering design was considered and dropped to keep pricing simple. Legacy VM resource claims are repaired by the status-reconcile cron in batches of 50, so create and resize requests do not fan out provider stats reads. Legacy resource metadata does not block new machines or consume another machine's capacity.
# Signed VM model-plane authorization

VM model traffic uses one `x-cmux-authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header. The
token is signed with HMAC-SHA-256 and contains `vm_id`, `team_id`, `owner_id`,
`aud`, `iat`, `exp`, `jti`, and a `kid` key-version claim. The signing key is
provided to the web deployment as the base64url value `CMUX_VM_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY`
and its active version as `CMUX_VM_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY_ID`. During rotation, keep
old verification keys in the JSON map `CMUX_VM_AUTH_SIGNING_PREVIOUS_KEYS`,
then remove them after the longest token lifetime (30 days).

The verifier requires the `cmux` issuer and `cmux-vm-model-plane` audience,
rejects malformed, expired, wrong-owner, and wrong-VM claims, and checks the
hashed token row for revocation and live VM ownership. Destroying a VM or
revoking its tokens therefore takes effect immediately even before a signing
key is retired. The edge injects this single header; guest clients and upstream
providers never receive the signing key or a separate VM-id credential header.
