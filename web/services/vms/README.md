# Cloud VMs service

Backend for `cmux vm new/ls/rm/exec/attach` and the sidebar Cloud VM surface. Stack Auth gates every public route. Provider API keys stay server-side. Blaxel, E2B, and Daytona machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon (transport `cmux-remote`); Freestyle still serves the legacy `cmuxd-remote` WebSocket PTY with short-lived leases, and older Freestyle VMs can fall back to its SSH gateway.

## HTTP surface

- `/api/vm`, authenticated `GET` list and `POST` create.
- `/api/vm/:id`, authenticated `DELETE` destroy.
- `/api/vm/:id/exec`, authenticated `POST` command execution.
- `/api/vm/:id/attach-endpoint`, authenticated `POST` PTY/RPC attach lease minting.
- `/api/vm/:id/ssh-endpoint`, authenticated `POST` legacy Freestyle SSH attach.

There is no raw actor or provider protocol endpoint. The old `/api/rivet/*` gateway has been removed.

## Authentication model

Public callers only use `/api/vm/*`. Each route calls Stack Auth first and returns `401` before any Postgres or provider operation when the caller is unauthenticated.

Ownership checks happen inside the Effect workflow by loading the VM row with both `user_id` and `provider_vm_id`. A user cannot destroy, exec, attach, or mint SSH credentials for a VM owned by another Stack Auth user.

Cookie-authenticated browser mutations also require a same-origin browser request. Native macOS
calls use `Authorization: Bearer` plus `X-Stack-Refresh-Token` and are not subject to browser CSRF.
For cookie calls, `POST`/`DELETE` routes reject cross-site `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` requests
before any VM workflow runs.

Cloud VM billing is team-scoped. The native client sends the selected Stack team in
`X-Cmux-Team-Id`; browser callers may send that header or `teamId`/`billingTeamId` in the request.
The backend validates membership before create or team-filtered list. If Stack returns one team,
the backend treats it as the personal team created on sign-up. If Stack returns no team, or multiple
teams without a selected/requested team, create fails before providers or billing are called.

The auth regression tests live in `web/tests/vm-route-auth.test.ts`. They verify unauthenticated create, list, destroy, attach, SSH endpoint, and exec requests return `401` before the VM workflow runs, and that cross-site cookie mutations are rejected.

## State model

- `cloud_vms` owns VM lifecycle state, provider ids, image ids, billing team/plan ids, and per-user idempotency keys.
- `cloud_vm_leases` stores hashed PTY/RPC/SSH lease tokens, provider identity handles, session ids, expiry, and revocation timestamps.
- `cloud_vm_usage_events` records lifecycle, attach, SSH, and exec events with billing team/plan ids for billing and audit rollups.

Create idempotency is enforced by the partial unique index on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`. A retry with the same key returns the existing VM after provisioning succeeds. A concurrent retry while the first create is still provisioning returns `409` instead of starting a second paid provider VM.

Active VM limits are enforced inside the same Postgres transaction that inserts the create row. The transaction takes a billing-team advisory lock before counting active VMs, so two concurrent creates for the same team cannot both pass the free-plan limit.

## Image manifest and rollback

Known-good provider images are recorded in `services/vms/images/manifest.json`. Each entry records
the provider, provider image id, cmux image version, build metadata, and validation status.

Default image policy:

- Production and staging select images with `E2B_CMUXD_WS_TEMPLATE`,
  `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT`, `DAYTONA_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT`, and for Blaxel `BLAXEL_SANDBOX_IMAGE`
  (base machines) plus `BLAXEL_SANDBOX_DESKTOP_IMAGE` (desktop machines).
- Clients request a machine **kind** (`kind: "desktop" | "base"` on `POST /api/vm`,
  `POST /api/vm/base/open`, and `POST /api/vm/base/reset`) rather than pinning an image id. With
  no `image`, the resolver picks the kind's env var, then the manifest entry flagged
  `kind` + `defaultForKind` (also in deployed runtimes), and only then fails. `image` still wins
  when present, and a body with neither keeps the legacy single-image behavior. Responses and
  `GET /api/vm` entries echo `kind`; `GET /api/vm` `limits.imageKinds` lists the kinds the
  default provider can serve and the image each resolves to.
- An image named by a provider env var is operator configuration and is accepted even when the
  manifest does not list it (logged once, `imageVersion: null`). Only a client-requested `image`
  must be in the manifest (or `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_UNMANIFESTED_IMAGES=1`). `vm_image_config_error`
  responses carry client-safe `details.imageRequested`, `details.kind`, `details.source`
  (`request` | `env` | `default`), and `details.allowedKinds`; the provider, env var name, manifest
  image ids, and reason go to the server log (`[vm-image-config-error]`) because API error
  payloads must not leak provider implementation details (see
  `expectNoCloudVmImplementationLeaks` in `tests/vm-route-auth.test.ts`).
- Local development uses the manifest entry marked `defaultForLocalDev` when the provider env var
  is unset.
- The current intended default provider is Blaxel. Set `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=blaxel` (the local
  loader supplies this when unset); Freestyle, E2B, and Daytona remain explicit rollback/provider
  overrides rather than silent fallbacks.
- Baked agent tools are installed at image-build time. They are not auto-updated on VM startup, so
  startup latency stays bounded and the active image manifest remains the source of truth.
- To update tool versions, rebuild the provider images and record the new template/snapshot IDs in
  the manifest. `CMUX_CLOUD_IMAGE_<TOOL>_NPM_SPEC` overrides must be exact npm package version
  pins, for example `@openai/codex@0.130.0`, or `none` to disable a tool. The image builder
  rejects ranges and tags such as `latest`.

Vercel production, staging, and preview deployments fail closed for VM create if the selected image
env var is missing or is not listed in the manifest. Local development can use the manifest default
without setting provider image env vars. Set `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_UNMANIFESTED_IMAGES=1` only for local
image experiments.

Rollback is an env-only operation:

1. Choose a previous manifest entry with `validationStatus: "passed"`.
2. Set `E2B_CMUXD_WS_TEMPLATE` or `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` back to that entry's `imageId`.
3. Redeploy staging, smoke test, then repeat for production.
4. Keep old provider templates/snapshots until all VMs using them are gone.

## Baked tools and VM-local cmux CLI

The E2B, Daytona, and Freestyle devbox images are defined in
`web/services/vms/images/devbox/` and baked with `web/scripts/build-devbox-e2b.ts`,
`build-devbox-daytona.ts`, and `build-devbox-freestyle.ts` (chatmux/Blaxel devbox
parity: devtools, mise node/python/bun, uv, gh, Chrome + cua-driver, pinned coding
agents, ble.sh devshell, agent-config generator). The session daemon is cmux-tui,
installed at create time from the pinned files.cmux.com artifacts manifest by
`services/vms/drivers/cmuxTuiDaemon.ts`; no daemon binary is baked. See the devbox
README for the bake + verify + manifest flow. The legacy cmuxd-remote image builder
(`build-cloud-vm-images.ts`) has been deleted; images it produced remain in the
manifest for reference but cannot serve the cmux-remote transport.

## Browser automation from Cloud VM SSH

`cmux browser ...` inside a `cmux ssh` or Cloud VM SSH session controls the local cmux browser
through the authenticated relay. It does not start Chrome inside the VM. This keeps browser UI,
cookies, profiles, and screenshots on the local Mac while agent computation runs remotely.

The Linux relay CLI supports the common browser automation subcommands: `open`, `navigate`, `back`,
`forward`, `reload`, `get-url`, `snapshot`, `eval`, `wait`, `click`, `dblclick`, `hover`, `focus`,
`check`, `uncheck`, `fill`, `type`, `press`, `select`, and `screenshot`. Existing-browser commands
default to `CMUX_SURFACE_ID`; `open` defaults to `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`.

## SSH session lifecycle

`cmux vm ssh <id>` and `cmux vm attach <id>` open a cmux-managed remote workspace. For providers
that return SSH attach info, the CLI resolves the VM endpoint and then uses the same workspace,
relay, startup, and session-state path as `cmux ssh`. `cmux vm ssh-info <id>` is the print-only
debugging command.

Plain `cmux ssh` uses OpenSSH control sockets and `ControlPersist` by default. If the foreground
SSH process exits after sleep or a network transition, the startup wrapper retries the same command
before reporting the session ended. `cmux ssh` and `cmux vm ssh` share this wrapper, so both paths
surface reconnect progress in the terminal and keep workspace remote state visible while the daemon
or proxy controller reconnects. Cloud VM provider sessions that expose only short-lived gateway
credentials may still require a fresh attach lease; after the retry limit is exhausted, the terminal
prints the existing disconnect banner instead of falling back silently to a local shell.

Manual sleep/network smoke:

1. Start a Cloud VM, then attach with `cmux vm ssh <id>`.
2. Confirm the terminal reaches a remote prompt and the sidebar shows the workspace as connected.
3. Disable Wi-Fi or sleep the Mac long enough for OpenSSH to exit.
4. Restore the network and confirm the terminal prints a reconnect attempt and either lands back in
   a remote prompt or clearly reports that the remote session ended.
5. Confirm the sidebar shows `Reconnecting` during retry and `Connected` after recovery.

## Effect conventions

Routes stay thin. They parse HTTP input, set span attributes, and run an Effect workflow.

`workflows.ts` composes explicit services:

- `VmRepository`, Postgres reads and writes.
- `VmProviderGateway`, provider SDK calls wrapped in typed Effect errors.

Provider SDKs remain Promise-based adapters under `drivers/`, but all route-visible backend logic is modeled as Effect values with typed errors and explicit dependencies.

## Deployment

Vercel runs the Next.js application and all VM REST routes. Postgres is the persistent control plane. There is no Rivet deployment for this feature.

Production and staging use Vercel Marketplace AWS Aurora PostgreSQL with OIDC federation and RDS IAM auth. The runtime does not need a long-lived database password.

Set these Vercel environment variables per production/staging environment:

- `CMUX_DB_DRIVER=aws-rds-iam`.
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`, IAM role Vercel assumes.
- `AWS_REGION`, Aurora region.
- `PGHOST`, Aurora cluster endpoint.
- `PGPORT`, usually `5432`.
- `PGUSER`, IAM-enabled Postgres role.
- `PGDATABASE`, app database name.
- `CMUX_DB_POOL_MAX`, small pool size for Vercel Functions. Start with `5`.
- `CMUX_DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`, optional. Leave unset for the current Vercel Marketplace Aurora databases so Node uses its default trust store.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED`, global create kill switch. Set `0` to block new paid creates while
  keeping list, attach, and delete available.
- `CMUX_VM_E2B_ENABLED`, per-provider E2B create kill switch.
- `CMUX_VM_FREESTYLE_ENABLED`, per-provider Freestyle create kill switch.
- `CMUX_VM_DAYTONA_ENABLED`, per-provider Daytona create kill switch.
- `CMUX_VM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, optional comma-separated extra origins allowed for cookie mutations.
- `E2B_API_KEY`, E2B provider key.
- `FREESTYLE_API_KEY`, Freestyle provider key.
- `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, Daytona provider key.
- `E2B_CMUXD_WS_TEMPLATE`, E2B template alias/name for WebSocket PTY sandboxes.
- `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT`, Freestyle snapshot id.
- `DAYTONA_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT`, Daytona snapshot name for WebSocket PTY sandboxes.
- `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, `blaxel`, `freestyle`, `e2b`, or `daytona` (defaults to `blaxel`).
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID`, optional Stack Auth team item used as the free-plan create-credit bucket. Leave unset to skip free-plan create-credit accounting; set to `none`, `disabled`, `off`, or `false` to explicitly opt out.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_COST`, optional free-plan per-create cost. Defaults to `1`.
- `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_INITIAL_CREATE_CREDITS`, optional first-use seed for the free-plan Stack Auth create-credit item. Defaults to `20`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID`, optional global Stack Auth item used as a prepaid create-credit bucket for every plan without a plan-specific item. Set to `none`, `disabled`, `off`, or `false` to opt out of create credits for plans without a plan-specific value.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST`, default `1`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST_E2B`, optional provider-specific override.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST_FREESTYLE`, optional provider-specific override.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_COST_DAYTONA`, optional provider-specific override.
- `CMUX_VM_FREE_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, default `5`.
- `CMUX_VM_PAID_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, default `10`.
- Stack Auth environment variables.
- Axiom/OpenTelemetry exporter variables.

Local development keeps using Docker Postgres through `DATABASE_URL`, derived from `CMUX_PORT`.

Run production/staging migrations explicitly, never during Vercel build or route startup. The local operator path pulls deployed Vercel env. The GitHub Actions path uses the minimal DB metadata copied into protected GitHub environments, generates an RDS IAM auth token, and applies Drizzle migrations:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- staging
bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- production
```

For local Docker Postgres, keep using:

```bash
bun db:migrate
```

Before a staging or production migration, run the preflight:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:preflight -- --schema-only .
```

Audit deployed env names without printing values:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- staging --strict
bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- production --strict
```

This audit is a local operator command. It intentionally does not run in GitHub Actions because
reading all Vercel env values from Actions would require a broad Vercel env-read token.

Smoke deployed API auth/list behavior without creating production VMs:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- staging
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- production
```

Staging may run a real create/destroy smoke with tiny quotas:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:smoke -- staging --create --provider e2b
```

Run default-provider stress before changing provider defaults or after provider incidents:

```bash
bun run cloud-vm:stress -- staging --count 8 --concurrency 4 --provider default
bun run cloud-vm:stress -- production --count 12 --concurrency 4 --provider default
```

## GitHub operations

Cloud VM migrations and smoke checks are exposed as manual GitHub Actions:

- `Cloud VM DB migration`
- `Cloud VM smoke`

They use these GitHub Environments:

- `cloud-vm-staging`
- `cloud-vm-production`

Each environment needs:

- variable `AWS_REGION`, usually `us-west-2`
- variables `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, and `PGDATABASE`
- variable `CMUX_DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`, usually `true`
- variables `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- secret `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY` for smoke workflows
- secret `AWS_MIGRATION_ROLE_ARN` for migration workflows

Production migration runs staging migration first on the same commit, then waits on the protected production environment approval.

## Local database development

Use `CMUX_PORT` to run multiple isolated web and database environments on one machine:

```bash
CMUX_PORT=10180 bun dev
```

`bun dev` sources `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env` (falling back to the legacy secret files), derives the local database URL from `CMUX_PORT`, starts this worktree's Docker Postgres, applies Drizzle migrations, then starts Next.js. When it exits or is interrupted, it stops the matching Docker container and network while preserving the Postgres volume.

The dev Postgres port is `CMUX_PORT + 10000`, so `CMUX_PORT=10180` maps to `localhost:20180`. `bun db:test` starts a separate test DB on `CMUX_PORT + 30000`, applies migrations twice, and runs behavior tests against a real Postgres container.

## Provider matrix

| Verb                        | Freestyle | E2B | Daytona | Blaxel |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----|---------|--------|
| `cmux vm new`               | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm new --workspace`   | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm new --detach`      | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm attach <id>`       | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm ssh <id>`          | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm ssh-info <id>`     | legacy SSH info only | legacy SSH info only | no (WebSocket only) | no (WebSocket only) |
| `cmux vm exec <id> -- ...`  | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| `cmux vm ls / rm`           | yes       | yes | yes | yes |
| snapshot / restore          | yes       | yes | yes | not yet |

`cmux vm ssh <id>` is the user-facing interactive alias and opens the same managed workspace path
as `cmux vm attach <id>`. `cmux vm ssh-info <id>` is print-only for provider SSH debugging.

Blaxel machines boot the baked `sandbox/cmux-devbox` image (template in
`services/vms/images/blaxel/`, published with `web/scripts/build-blaxel-image.sh` on
Blaxel's remote builder): chatmux-devbox tool parity (mise node/python/bun, uv, gh,
devtools, pinned coding agents, ble.sh, half-life prompt, seeded history) plus an
openbox/TigerVNC desktop with Ghostty, Chrome, and noVNC on 6901. The image stamps
`/etc/cmux/image-stamp`, which short-circuits the driver's create-time provisioning
fallback for stock images, and keeps the stock desktop contract (`start-vnc.sh` as user
`cua`, RFB 5901) so the driver's VNC heal works unchanged. Stock `blaxel/xfce-vnc:latest`
remains a validated manifest fallback (`BLAXEL_SANDBOX_IMAGE`;
`blaxel/base-image:latest` with `cmux vm new --base`). Machines run no cmuxd-remote: the
driver bootstraps every image, baked or stock, at create time with the **cmux-tui remote
daemon as the machine's only session daemon**.
The sandbox downloads the pinned static-musl `cmux-tui` build onto its persistent home
volume (`/root/.cmux/bin/cmux-tui`, sha256-verified inside the VM with `sha256sum -c`,
reused on resurrection) and the sandbox supervisor runs `cmux-tui server start --session
cloud --remote-ws 0.0.0.0:1337`. The build and its digest come from the artifacts manifest
published by `.github/workflows/cmux-tui-artifacts.yml` — nothing is pinned by hand.
Config: `BL_API_KEY`, `BL_WORKSPACE`; optionally `CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL` to pin a
deployment to one commit's `https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui/<commit>/manifest.json` instead
of the rolling `latest`. Blaxel freezes a sandbox ~15 s after the last connection unless a
`keepAlive` process runs; the smart-sleep watcher is that process and exits once every
cmux-tui shell is idle and no client is connected, so an idle machine drops to (free)
standby and the next attach wakes it.

The persistent home volume (`/root`) is sized from the machine's memory in dev-box tiers
(`defaultHomeVolumeMbForMemory`: ≤4 GB → 8 GB, otherwise 16 GB — Blaxel refuses volumes
above 16 GB (measured 2026-08-26), so the 24 GB plan default gets the 16 GB ceiling instead of the
old flat 5 GB); `CMUX_VM_BLAXEL_HOME_VOLUME_MB` pins every
new volume to one size instead. The chosen size is recorded as `providerMetadata.homeVolumeMb`.
Volumes are never resized: existing machines keep the volume they were created with, and a
size Blaxel's volume API rejects fails the create with the provider's message.

Preview ingress is enforced private: attach only reuses a preview whose spec is not public,
replaces a public one, and refuses a preview that comes back public, so the daemon is never
reachable without a minted preview token. The daemon has two previews for port 1337: the
branded `https://<machine>.vm.cmux.sh` host (whose ingress refuses WebSocket upgrades
without a User-Agent, so it is handed only to clients advertising the
`direct-ws-user-agent` capability from `cmux-tui remote-probe --json`) and the raw
`<hash>.preview.bl.run` host for everyone else. `POST /api/vm/[id]/attach-endpoint` with
`{"transport":"cmux-remote","clientCapabilities":[...]}` returns
`{route, token, session, daemonBuild?, invitation?}` where `route` is
`wss://<host>/v1/link?bl_preview_token=…` and `invitation` is a single-use
`cmux://enroll/…` URI minted only when the caller's device is not enrolled. The client
connects with `cmux-tui remote connect <route> --invite-file …`, then
`POST /api/vm/[id]/cmux-remote/approve {invitationId}` approves the pending claim (poll
until `state` is `approved`). The legacy websocket/SSH attach (`attach-endpoint` without a
transport, `POST /api/vm/[id]/sessions`) answers `409 vm_attach_transport_unsupported` on
Blaxel machines with `details.supportedTransports: ["cmux-remote"]`. `cmux vm shell`,
`cmux vm new`, `cmux vm base open` and the Machines panel all drive this from the Mac.
See docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md for the design. Live driver E2E:
`bun scripts/test-blaxel-vm-poc.ts`.

E2B and Daytona machines run the same cmux-tui daemon and only the `cmux-remote`
transport. The E2B route is the sandbox's public port host
(`wss://1337-<id>.e2b.app/v1/link`; the proxy's only request auth is a header the
dialer cannot send, so sandboxes are created with public port traffic and the
daemon's Noise enrollment gates sessions). The Daytona route is the preview proxy
with its token as the `DAYTONA_SANDBOX_AUTH_KEY` query parameter; preview tokens
reset on sandbox restart, so the backend mints a fresh link per attach. cmux does
not use Daytona's SSH gateway. The backend writes only a hash of attach tokens to
Postgres; raw tokens are returned once to the Mac client. Machines created by the
old cmuxd-remote drivers cannot serve this transport and need recreation.

Operational note: Blaxel is the intended default. Before rollout or rollback, verify the deployed
`CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, `CMUX_VM_BLAXEL_ENABLED`, `BL_API_KEY`, and `BL_WORKSPACE` env values
with `bun run cloud-vm:env:audit -- <target> --strict`, then confirm WebSocket PTY, reusable
daemon RPC lease, and browser proxy health with `bun run cloud-vm:stress -- <target> --provider default`.
Keep Freestyle/E2B enabled only when deliberately selecting them as rollback providers.

## Usage, limits, and pricing

The usage ledger is in Postgres. VM create pricing gates can use Stack Auth payment items, but free-plan create credits are opt-in. Configure `CMUX_VM_PLAN_FREE_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` only when the free plan should consume a prepaid create-credit bucket. When enabled, the create workflow records a one-time local grant row, seeds the configured Stack Auth item credits once per billing team, reserves one create credit only for a newly inserted row, calls the provider, and refunds the credit if provisioning fails before a usable VM exists.

Plan limits are team-based. Stack Auth personal teams should stay enabled for both dev/staging and production projects (`createTeamOnSignUp` / `teams.createPersonalTeamOnSignUp`). New VM rows store `billing_team_id` and `billing_plan_id`; the free plan allows three active VMs at a time by default (`CMUX_VM_FREE_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`). Paused and destroyed VMs do not count against the active limit. Paid plan activation should write a readable plan id such as `pro` into Stack Auth team read-only metadata (`cmuxVmPlan`) or equivalent billing sync metadata, then configure the matching `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS` env var. Paid plans only consume Stack Auth create credits when `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` or the global `CMUX_VM_CREATE_CREDIT_ITEM_ID` is configured.

### The free limit is the paywall moment

`vmActiveLimitExceededResponse` (routeHelpers) renders every provisioning verb's over-limit error. On unpaid plans the message sells the upgrade — "The free plan includes 3 Cloud VMs" with `upgradeRequired: true` and `upgradeUrl` pointing at `/pricing` — so clients can show a real upgrade prompt (checkout flow per `skills/cmux-billing`) instead of a dead error. Paid plans keep operational "stop or delete one" guidance; their cap is a safety rail, not a paywall.

### Usage-based billing after Pro (design, not yet wired)

Pro subscribers should pay by usage on top of the subscription. The meter is **GB-RAM-awake-seconds**, which matches the provider cost model exactly on Blaxel (standby is free; smart sleep drops idle sandboxes to standby, so users only accrue usage while something is actually running or attached). Pipeline: the `vm-reconcile` cron already polls provider statuses — record `vm.state.running` / `vm.state.standby` transitions as `cloud_vm_usage_events`; a billing cron aggregates the transition intervals × memory into per-team usage and posts Stripe usage records against a metered price on the Pro subscription (provisioned alongside `cmux-pro-monthly`, see `skills/cmux-billing`). Postgres stays the ledger of record; Stripe receives idempotent per-period rollups, never raw events.
