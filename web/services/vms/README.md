# Cloud VMs service

Backend for `cmux vm new/ls/rm/exec/attach` and the sidebar Cloud VM surface. Stack Auth gates every public route. Provider API keys stay server-side. Freestyle and E2B prefer `cmuxd-remote` WebSocket PTY with short-lived leases; older Freestyle VMs can fall back to its SSH gateway.

## HTTP surface

- `/api/vm`, authenticated `GET` list and `POST` create.
- `/api/vm/:id`, authenticated `DELETE` destroy.
- `/api/vm/:id/exec`, authenticated `POST` command execution.
- `/api/vm/:id/attach-endpoint`, authenticated `POST` PTY/RPC attach lease minting.
- `/api/vm/:id/ssh-endpoint`, authenticated `POST` legacy Freestyle SSH attach.

There is no raw actor or provider protocol endpoint. The old `/api/rivet/*` gateway has been removed.

## Authentication model

Public callers only use `/api/vm/*`. Each route calls Stack Auth first and returns `401` before any Postgres or provider operation when the caller is unauthenticated.

Ownership checks happen inside the Effect workflow by loading the VM row with both `user_id` and `provider_vm_id`. A user cannot destroy, exec, attach, or mint SSH credentials for a VM owned by another Stack Auth user.

The auth regression tests live in `web/tests/vm-route-auth.test.ts`. They verify unauthenticated create, list, destroy, attach, SSH endpoint, and exec requests return `401` before the VM workflow runs.

## State model

- `cloud_vms` owns VM lifecycle state, provider ids, image ids, billing team/plan ids, and per-user idempotency keys.
- `cloud_vm_leases` stores hashed PTY/RPC/SSH lease tokens, provider identity handles, session ids, expiry, and revocation timestamps.
- `cloud_vm_usage_events` records lifecycle, attach, SSH, and exec events with billing team/plan ids for billing and audit rollups.

Create idempotency is enforced by the partial unique index on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`. A retry with the same key returns the existing VM after provisioning succeeds. A concurrent retry while the first create is still provisioning returns `409` instead of starting a second paid provider VM.

Active VM limits are enforced inside the same Postgres transaction that inserts the create row. The transaction takes a billing-team advisory lock before counting active VMs, so two concurrent creates for the same team cannot both pass the free-plan limit.

## Effect conventions

Routes stay thin. They parse HTTP input, set span attributes, and run an Effect workflow.

`workflows.ts` composes explicit services:

- `VmRepository`, Postgres reads and writes.
- `VmProviderGateway`, provider SDK calls wrapped in typed Effect errors.

Provider SDKs remain Promise-based adapters under `drivers/`, but all route-visible backend logic is modeled as Effect values with typed errors and explicit dependencies.

## Deployment

Vercel runs the Next.js application and all VM REST routes. Postgres is the persistent control plane. There is no Rivet deployment for this feature.

Production and staging use Vercel Marketplace AWS Aurora PostgreSQL with OIDC federation and RDS IAM auth. The runtime does not need a long-lived database password.

Set these Vercel environment variables per production/staging environment:

- `CMUX_DB_DRIVER=aws-rds-iam`.
- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`, IAM role Vercel assumes.
- `AWS_REGION`, Aurora region.
- `PGHOST`, Aurora cluster endpoint.
- `PGPORT`, usually `5432`.
- `PGUSER`, IAM-enabled Postgres role.
- `PGDATABASE`, app database name.
- `CMUX_DB_POOL_MAX`, small pool size for Vercel Functions. Start with `5`.
- `CMUX_DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`, currently `false` unless an RDS CA certificate is configured.
- `E2B_API_KEY`, E2B provider key.
- `FREESTYLE_API_KEY`, Freestyle provider key.
- `E2B_CMUXD_WS_TEMPLATE`, E2B template alias/name for WebSocket PTY sandboxes.
- `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT`, Freestyle snapshot id.
- `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`, `freestyle` or `e2b`.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, Upstash Redis REST endpoint/token for rate limits.
- `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, equivalent Vercel Marketplace Upstash env names.
- `REDIS_URL` or `KV_URL`, supported for Redis protocol connections when REST envs are not available.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_BURST`, default `3`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_BURST_WINDOW_MS`, default `600000`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_DAILY`, default `20`.
- `CMUX_VM_CREATE_RATE_LIMIT_DAILY_WINDOW_MS`, default `86400000`.
- `CMUX_VM_CONTROL_RATE_LIMIT_BURST`, default `600`.
- `CMUX_VM_CONTROL_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, default `60000`.
- `CMUX_VM_FREE_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, default `1`.
- `CMUX_VM_PAID_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS`, default `10`.
- Stack Auth environment variables.
- Axiom/OpenTelemetry exporter variables.

Local development keeps using Docker Postgres through `DATABASE_URL` and Docker Redis through `REDIS_URL`, both derived from `CMUX_PORT`.

Run production/staging migrations explicitly, never during Vercel build or route startup:

```bash
CMUX_DB_DRIVER=aws-rds-iam bun db:migrate:aws-rds-iam
```

For local Docker Postgres, keep using:

```bash
bun db:migrate
```

## Local database development

Use `CMUX_PORT` to run multiple isolated web and database environments on one machine:

```bash
CMUX_PORT=10180 bun dev
```

`bun dev` sources `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env` (falling back to the legacy secret files), derives local database and Redis URLs from `CMUX_PORT`, starts this worktree's Docker Postgres and Redis, applies Drizzle migrations, then starts Next.js. When it exits or is interrupted, it stops the matching Docker containers and network while preserving the Postgres volume.

The dev Postgres port is `CMUX_PORT + 10000`, so `CMUX_PORT=10180` maps to `localhost:20180`. The dev Redis port is `CMUX_PORT + 20000`. `bun db:test` starts a separate test DB on `CMUX_PORT + 30000` and test Redis on `CMUX_PORT + 40000`, applies migrations twice, and runs behavior tests against real Postgres and Redis containers.

## Provider matrix

| Verb                        | Freestyle | E2B |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----|
| `cmux vm new`               | yes       | yes |
| `cmux vm new --workspace`   | yes       | yes |
| `cmux vm new --detach`      | yes       | yes |
| `cmux vm attach <id>`       | yes       | yes |
| `cmux vm exec <id> -- ...`  | yes       | yes |
| `cmux vm ls / rm`           | yes       | yes |

E2B interactive paths require a cmuxd WebSocket PTY image. The backend writes only a hash of attach tokens to Postgres; raw tokens are returned once to the Mac client.

## Usage, limits, and pricing

The usage ledger is in Postgres. Hot request throttling is in Redis, keyed by Stack Auth user id. VM create has burst and daily limits because it can spend provider money. Other VM endpoints use a generous control-plane limit.

Plan limits are team-based. Stack Auth personal teams should stay enabled for both dev/staging and production projects. New VM rows store `billing_team_id` and `billing_plan_id`; the free plan allows one active VM by default. Paid plan activation should write a readable plan id such as `pro` into Stack Auth team read-only metadata (`cmuxVmPlan`) or equivalent billing sync metadata, then configure the matching `CMUX_VM_PLAN_<PLAN>_MAX_ACTIVE_VMS` env var.
