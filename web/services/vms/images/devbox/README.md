# cmux Cloud devbox image (Freestyle)

The devbox definition for cmux Cloud machines. The Dockerfile here is the
reference recipe: Ubuntu 24.04 (the distro every Freestyle machine runs),
the shell layer, and the **desktop layer** from `desktop/`, started by the
`cmux-devbox-boot` supervisor when there is no systemd (`docker build` proves
the whole desktop at build time). `web/scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts`
builds the same devbox on top of the `freestyle/ubuntu` base VM: it reads the
desktop package list, the Ghostty `.deb` and the agent pins from the
Dockerfile's `ARG`s (`devbox-image-common.ts`) and installs the desktop files
through the one `DEVBOX_DESKTOP_INSTALLS` map, so the two recipes cannot
drift. Parity targets are the chatmux devbox
(`chatmux:infra/sandbox-images/Dockerfile`) for the shell layer: same
devtools, node/python/bun, uv, gh, Chrome + cua-driver, pinned coding agents,
ble.sh ghost text, half-life prompt, seeded history, and the coderouter
agent-config generator.

On Freestyle the toolchain is the base's, not mise: `freestyle/ubuntu`
already ships Node LTS under nvm (symlinked into `/usr/local/bin`), Bun,
Python 3.12, uv, Docker (running from boot), and its own copies of Claude
Code, Codex and OpenCode. The bake keeps all of that and replaces the agent
copies with the exact Dockerfile pins (`npm install -g` on the base's npm,
every agent bin symlinked into `/usr/local/bin` so daemon panes resolve them
without a login profile), and installs `bubblewrap`, codex's Linux sandbox
prerequisite, so codex runs on the distro's `bwrap` instead of warning on
every launch that it is falling back to its bundled copy. A cmux login banner
(`cmux-motd`, rendered by pam_motd on SSH) replaces the stock Ubuntu and
Freestyle motd text.

## Agent pins: bump, epoch, promote

The coding agents are exact npm releases in the Dockerfile's `ARG
CMUX_IMAGE_<TOOL>_VERSION` lines, and machines never self-update
(`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` for Claude Code, `check_for_update_on_startup =
false` for codex), so a new Claude Code or Codex reaches cmux Cloud only
through a rebake:

```bash
# from web/
bun run devbox:pins:check            # pins next to the npm registry's current releases; exit 1 when behind
bun run devbox:pins:check --write    # rewrite the ARG lines to those releases
```

then bump `CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH` in the same file and promote both ladders (see
"Promote" below). `--write` touches only the ARG lines and refuses ranges,
tags and packages the image does not bake; the chatmux devbox template
(`chatmux:infra/sandbox-images/Dockerfile`) is bumped by hand in its own
repo to keep the parity the header describes.

Two invariants keep the checked-in manifest describing the machine users get
(`devboxSourceDriftProblems` in `devbox-image-common.ts`, run by
`devbox:manifest:check`, `vm-image-manifest.test.ts` and `promote` before it
writes):

- every `defaultForKind` entry was baked at the Dockerfile's current
  `CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH` (the entry's `epoch`, or the `cmux devbox epoch` prefix
  of its `notes` on older entries), so an epoch bump lands together with its
  promotion and a rollback to an older ladder also reverts the sources;
- an entry that recorded `devboxSource` (`{ layers, digest, schema }`,
  `devboxSourceDigest()`: sha256 over the files the bake ships verbatim, the
  agent, cua-driver and Ghostty pins, the desktop apt list, the epoch and,
  from schema 2, the Dockerfile's instructions (its comments dropped by the
  Dockerfile grammar, parser directives kept) and every non-blank line of
  `build-devbox-freestyle.ts`, comments included, per layer set. Dockerfile
  prose is excluded because a comment cannot change a machine; bake-script
  comments are intentionally part of the digest, because telling a comment
  from code in TypeScript needs a full lexer and any line heuristic can hide
  a code change, so a comment-only edit to the bake script also asks for a
  re-promotion) was baked from exactly this checkout's sources. An entry is checked with the schema it was recorded
  with (absent: 1), so a formula change never forces a rebake; new bakes
  record `DEVBOX_SOURCE_SCHEMA`, and `bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle
  --upgrade-source-schema` moves older defaults up without a bake only where
  every input the newer schema adds is proven from what the entry recorded:
  its digest at its own schema, its `builderScriptVersion` against this
  checkout's bake script, and the Dockerfile's instructions at its
  `repoCommit` (read from git) against this checkout's. Anything else is
  kept and reported; a rebake is the only other way up.

Rollback is therefore a revert of the promotion commit as a whole, never the
manifest flags alone.

## One work user, one machine name (`workUser.ts`)

Every prompt on a cmux Cloud machine reads `cmux@cmux`. Both halves are
contract, not decoration:

- The work user is **`cmux`** (uid 1000, `/home/cmux`, passwordless sudo):
  the base's `ubuntu` account **renamed** right after the machine's own name is
  set, before any layer writes into the home or names the account. Freestyle's exec API
  resolves its default `linuxUser` to "the account holding uid 1000", so a
  rename (rather than a second account) keeps the provider's own surfaces,
  SSH, the desktop session, and the terminals the cmux-tui daemon opens all
  in one home. The base's `/etc/sudoers.d/90-freestyle` names the old
  account, so the step replaces every sudoers drop-in that does not name
  `cmux`.
- The machine is named **`cmux`**, not the base's `freestyle-vm`. That half is
  its own contract (`services/vms/images/identity.ts`): the static and live
  name, the loopback alias, per-machine SSH host keys, and a residue audit.
- **Sessions are not root.** Coding agents refuse to run as root:
  `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` exits before it starts. The daemon
  drops to `cmux` (docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md), root stays one `sudo`
  away, and the verifier proves both that the refusal is gone and that a pane
  the daemon opens really reports `cmux@cmux`.

The default Bash prompt shows `cmux@<vm-name>`. It reads `/etc/cmux/vm-name`
with Bash's built-in `read` before each prompt. Create and attach install
the current name. Rename updates it on a running machine. A paused or
unreachable machine gets the saved name on its next attach. The prompt name
uses the display label in lowercase with hyphens, or the generated slug when
there is no usable label. Routing ids do not change.

Set `PS1` after the `/etc/cmux/bashrc` source line in `~/.bashrc` to customize
the prompt. For example, `PS1='\u@${__cmux_vm_name}:\w\$ '` keeps the live
name with a different layout. A fixed prompt or a prompt tool also works.
The line editor attaches at the first prompt, after these user settings load.
Remove the source line to replace the full cmux shell setup. Lifecycle updates
only write system defaults, never user rc files or prompt settings. The
name reader never rewrites `PS1`, runs Git, calls the network, or starts a
child process. The shell variable is local scratch state, not exported
configuration. After the first upgrade, open a new shell to load this setup. That shell then reads
later name changes at its next prompt without a restart.

The Dockerfile and Freestyle recipe use these same shell files.
`vm-devbox-image.test.ts` checks the image contract; `vm-guest-prompt.test.ts`
checks live prompt updates and user overrides.

## Desktop layer (`desktop/`)

Ported from the retired Blaxel `sandbox/cmux-devbox` image, the same stack
on every provider: TigerVNC serving an openbox session with the tint2 dock
(Chrome, Files, Ghostty), Thunar, the CC0 mountain-lake wallpaper, the
accessibility bus for computer-use, TigerVNC's clipboard helper, and noVNC
on 6901. The contract (`web/services/vms/images/desktop.ts`;
`vm-devbox-desktop.test.ts` pins it, the Mac app's Displays row, the CLI's
`cloudVMDesktopPort` and the Freestyle driver's `openPort` depend on it):

- `start-vnc.sh` runs as the work user `cmux` with `HOME=/home/cmux`
  and `DISPLAY=:1`, so the desktop session is the same account terminals
  and SSH land in; RFB on **5901 loopback-only** (no VNC auth: the owner's
  private network is the only ingress), noVNC via websockify on **6901**
  at `/`. Idempotent: every component is guarded by a liveness probe.
- The session runs one D-Bus session bus (reused across supervisor passes),
  the accessibility bus (`at-spi-bus-launcher --launch-immediately`, so
  `cua-driver`'s `get_window_state` resolves window trees), openbox, feh
  (wallpaper), tint2, `vncconfig -nowin` (clipboard between the noVNC pane
  and X apps), a resize watcher (noVNC remote resize re-fills the wallpaper
  and nudges the dock), and websockify.
- It publishes `DISPLAY` and the accessibility bus (`AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS` for
  AT-SPI clients, `AT_SPI_BUS` for `cua-driver doctor`) at `/run/cmux-desktop/env`
  (the unit's `RuntimeDirectory=`, owned by `cmux`, readable by all).
  `/etc/cmux/desktop-env.sh`, sourced by `/etc/profile.d/cmux-desktop.sh`
  and the bashrc chain (every pane the cmux-tui daemon opens, root's
  included), points any shell without a `DISPLAY` at the desktop while it
  is up, so `agent-browser`, `xdotool` and `cua-driver mcp`/`call` act on
  the screen a person can watch. The desktop session and the cmux-tui daemon
  are the same account, so an app started from a terminal pane joins the
  session bus of the screen a person is watching; root gets `DISPLAY` but not
  that bus (it admits only its owner).
- Readiness is signalled by its owners, never inferred from elapsed time:
  Xvnc reports its display on `-displayfd` once it accepts connections, the
  accessibility bus is awaited by name (`gdbus wait org.a11y.Bus`), the
  resize watcher reacts to RandR events (`xev`), and the unit is
  `Type=notify`: `start-vnc.sh` sends READY once the display, noVNC and the
  published env are up, so `systemctl start cmux-desktop` (the driver's
  port-open heal, the bake) returns exactly when the screen is usable.
  websockify has no readiness signal of its own, so its 6901 bind is the one
  bounded connect wait (`wait_listening`).
- The `cmux-desktop` systemd unit runs `cmux-desktop-boot` as `cmux`,
  which re-asserts Chrome's pre-accepted first run and re-runs the
  idempotent `start-vnc.sh` every 30 s. In a container (no systemd) the
  `cmux-devbox-boot` boot supervisor starts the same `cmux-desktop-boot` as
  the uid-1000 account and restarts it if it exits; under systemd it starts
  nothing (the bake and the verifier count exactly one desktop supervisor).
- `cmux` has passwordless sudo, so coding agents' root-refusing modes
  (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) work, and the cmux-tui daemon
  runs sessions as that same account.
- Agents are trusted everywhere. codex: `codex-managed.toml` is baked to
  `/etc/codex/managed_config.toml` with `trust_level = "trusted"` for `/root`
  and the work user's home, and the `codex()` function in `agent-config.sh` adds the
  launch directory's git root per invocation (codex trust is exact-path).
  claude: `agent-config.sh` seeds `~/.claude.json` (onboarding done, bypass
  accepted, the placeholder API key approved, `/` trusted) and exports `CLAUDE_CODE_SANDBOXED=1` (trust gate)
  and `IS_SANDBOX=1` (root gate for `--dangerously-skip-permissions`), plus
  `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` so the pinned Claude Code does not reinstall itself
  on first launch;
  `managed-settings.json` sets `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt`.
- Ghostty comes from a pinned community `.deb` for Ubuntu 24.04
  (`ARG CMUX_IMAGE_GHOSTTY_DEB_URL` in the Dockerfile, verified against
  `ARG CMUX_IMAGE_GHOSTTY_DEB_SHA256` before dpkg runs); the apt list is
  `ARG CMUX_IMAGE_DESKTOP_PACKAGES`. `devbox-image-common.ts` reads all three.

One snapshot serves both kinds: the desktop bake is promoted as the default
for `desktop` and for `base` alike (`--kinds desktop,base`, the default for a
desktop bake), so every machine cmux Cloud creates is this devbox with its
screen, whatever kind a client names (`VM_IMAGE_DEFAULT_KIND` in
`services/vms/images/resolver.ts` is desktop for a request that names none).
`devbox:bake:freestyle --no-desktop` can still bake a shell-only image for
experiments; it is not promoted, and the verifier reads `/etc/cmux/image-stamp`
and rejects a desktop snapshot passed as a base image. A daemon change (the
cmux-tui pin) reaches machines only through a rebake: the driver's
attach-time heal never upgrades a healthy baked daemon.

The Freestyle base slug is only the input to the cmux bake. The ids recorded in
`manifest.json` are cmux-derived snapshots, created by baking cmux-tui and its
contract first, then resizing and re-booting each shape. Never point a machine
at a raw `freestyle/*` base, because it has no cmux-tui state or startup
contract.

Reaching it: the Freestyle driver's `openPort(vmId, 6901)` (the app's
Displays row, `cmux vm open <m>:desktop`) returns
`http://<private VPC IPv4>:6901/vnc.html?path=websockify`, reachable only
over the owner's WireGuard tunnel, exactly the path the daemon route takes,
after a guest-side heal that is one blocking `systemctl start cmux-desktop`
(the unit's READY is the signal). No public ingress is ever opened for it: noVNC has no
auth of its own, so a machine outside a private network gets an error, not
a public URL. `desktopWrapper.ts` stays the seam for a future public TLS
edge. The daemon still runs as root, so root shells get `DISPLAY` but not
the session bus.

## Identity: the machine is `cmux`

`web/services/vms/images/identity.ts` is the contract. The Freestyle base
calls every VM `freestyle-vm` (static in `/etc/hostname`, the `127.0.1.1`
alias in `/etc/hosts`, the comment on its SSH host keys), so before this
contract a cmux machine introduced itself as the provider's in every pane
(`root@freestyle-vm in ~ λ`), in `hostname`, `$HOSTNAME`, `uname -n`, the
journal, and the host-key comments. The bake's `identity` step, right after
the base inventory, renames it:

- **Hostname `cmux`**, static and live (`hostnamectl set-hostname`, with a
  file-plus-`sethostname` fallback), and the `127.0.1.1 cmux` alias so
  `getent hosts cmux` and sudo resolve it. Only the alias line of
  `/etc/hosts` changes; the provider's `# BEGIN freestyle-tls-egress` block
  and every other line stay byte for byte.
- **SSH host keys regenerated** under the new name (the base's keys were
  generated when Freestyle built its rootfs and are shared by every VM booted
  from that base). `cmux-devbox-boot` regenerates them again on every clone,
  in a detached subshell so the daemon start never waits, so no two machines
  from one snapshot share a host key.
- **The journal starts over** in the cleanup step, so a machine's log begins
  under its own name instead of with the base's boot as `freestyle-vm`.

The `identity-final` step before the stamp re-runs the check plus a
whole-word residue audit (`freestyle-vm` under `/etc`, `/home`, `/root`,
`/usr/local`, `/opt`, package trees skipped). `verify-devbox-image.ts` proves
the same on a machine booted from the snapshot, plus the prompt a person sees
in a real pty for both accounts, a journal that knows no other name, and
different host keys on a second machine; `derive-devbox-sizes.ts` checks the
hostname on the master and on every derived size after its own boot.

What stays the provider's, on purpose, because the exec/fs API and the
transport run on it: the guest agent (`freestyle-vms-agent.service`,
`/sbin/freestyle-vms-agent`), its first-boot host-key unit
(`freestyle-vms-hostkeys.service`, inert once keys exist), the resolver
drop-in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/60-freestyle-vms.conf`, the power-off
wrappers in `/usr/local/sbin`, the TLS-egress block in `/etc/hosts`, the
metadata service at 169.254.169.254, and the gateway endpoints
(`vm-ssh.freestyle.sh`, `*.vm.freestyle.sh`). Those name the platform
(`freestyle-vms`), never the machine, and the whole-word audit leaves them
alone. The container recipe has no identity step: `docker build` mounts
`/etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts` from the daemon and the runtime names each
container, so the hostname there is the runtime's.

## Terminal capabilities (`cmux-terminfo.src`)

Daemon-spawned shells get the TERM the Mac exports (`xterm-256color`, or
`xterm-ghostty` when passed through) plus `COLORTERM=truecolor`, and inherit
`TERM_PROGRAM=ghostty` with `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` from
`/etc/cmux/ghostty-version` (the Ghostty .deb pin, written by the bake and
the Dockerfile) via the supervisor's environment, the same identity the app
exports to local and SSH shells. Claude Code and other agents gate
synchronized output, progress reporting, strikethrough, and Cmd-click on
`TERM_PROGRAM`; `verify-devbox-image.ts` reads the daemon's environ to prove
it. Programs still resolve TERM against the guest's terminfo. Stock ncurses
`xterm-256color` advertises no truecolor (`Tc`) or styled underlines (`Su`)
and emits SGR 90 for `setaf 8`, which the cmux renderer shows as invisible
ghost text. `cmux-terminfo.src` is the app's `Resources/terminfo-overlay`
(Ghostty's entry under both names, bright colors 8-15 as `38;5;n`) as
`infocmp -x` source; the bake compiles it into `/etc/terminfo`, ahead of
`/lib` and `/usr/share` in ncurses' search order, before seeding ble.sh's
per-TERM tput caches. Regenerate it from a cmux checkout with the command in
its header when the overlay changes; `vm-devbox-image.test.ts` compiles and
queries it, and `verify-devbox-image.ts` proves the same on a fresh machine.

## Session daemon: cmux-tui

Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon on port 1337
(transport `cmux-remote`, docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The Freestyle bake
installs the pinned files.cmux.com build (sha256-verified, the driver's own
install command) at `/home/cmux/.cmux/bin/cmux-tui`, proves the daemon answers,
then parks it, because a Freestyle snapshot is a memory image and a live
daemon would give every machine the builder's Noise identity. The
`cmux-devbox-boot` supervisor, run by the baked `cmux-tui-daemon` systemd
unit with `CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337` (the driver reaches the daemon
at the VM's IPv6 address, so the listener must be dual-stack), reads the
platform instance id from the metadata service, wipes the remote identity
when the machine is a clone, and starts the daemon. The driver runs no
bootstrap at create; it heals pin drift and a missing listener on attach
(`web/services/vms/drivers/cmuxTuiDaemon.ts`). The container Dockerfile still
ships only the supervisor and waits for a driver install.

Shells spawned by the daemon get the bash devshell (ble.sh ghost text,
half-life prompt, seeded history) through the `/etc/bash.bashrc` chain.

## Sizes: one bake, one snapshot per size

A Freestyle VM boots at its snapshot's size and resize is grow-only, so the
bake happens once on the ladder floor (`freestyle/ubuntu-sm`, 2 vCPU / 4 GiB /
16 GB) and `derive-devbox-sizes.ts` turns it into one snapshot per size:
boot the bake, `vm.resize`, snapshot, delete, then boot the derived snapshot
once more and check `nproc`, memory, the grown root filesystem and the
daemon/desktop units. Sizes are Freestyle's own ladder
(`web/services/vms/images/sizes.ts`, verbatim from freestyle-vms
`catalog/snapshots.json`), so every cmux machine is a shape Freestyle already
bills and caps:

| name | vCPU | memory | disk | Freestyle base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sm` | 2 | 4 GiB | 16 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-sm` |
| `md` | 4 | 8 GiB | 32 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu` |
| `lg` | 8 | 16 GiB | 64 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-lg` |
| `lgx` | 12 | 24 GiB | 96 GB | derived snapshot |
| `xl` | 16 | 32 GiB | 128 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-xl` |
| `2xl` | 32 | 64 GiB | 128 GB | `freestyle/ubuntu-2xl` |

The manifest records one entry per kind and size (`size: { name, cpu,
memoryMb, storageMb }`), each the default for its kind+size. The resolver
picks the smallest size whose memory covers the plan's `memoryMb`
(`defaultMemoryMbForPlan`; today's default of 8 GiB lands on `md`), so
the driver never resizes at create and nothing has to grow at boot. Snapshot
slugs are `cmux-devbox-<size>` (`cmux-devbox` for `md`).

Run `bun run devbox:manifest:check` before a promotion. It requires one
validated default for every size in both ladders and checks the recorded CPU,
memory, and disk values against `sizes.ts`.

### BusyBox probe

`freestyle/busybox` is not a supported machine image. It has only BusyBox
utilities and no systemd or cmux devbox contract. To measure whether a future
shell-only image can run cmux-tui, use the disposable probe:

```bash
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:probe:busybox --fx
```

The probe installs the pinned static cmux-tui build, starts the daemon, runs the
small `fx` binary, records RSS, and deletes the VM. It never writes the image
manifest. A BusyBox result becomes a product option only after a separate
cmux-derived bake passes the same daemon, persistence, and attach checks as the
Ubuntu ladder.

## Promote: bake, verify, derive sizes, record (one command)

The checked-in manifest (`web/services/vms/images/manifest.json`) is the
only source of truth for the image users get: the resolver serves the entry
flagged `defaultForKind` for the requested kind and the plan's size, in local
dev and every deployed runtime alike, and no env var selects or overrides
it. `promote-devbox-image.ts` is the only sanctioned writer:

```bash
# from web/, with the Freestyle key in env
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle                     # bake -> verify -> sm,md,lg,lgx,xl,2xl -> manifest
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --sizes lg,xl       # a subset of the ladder
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --sizes none        # one size-less entry (pre-ladder behaviour)
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --image sh-…        # verify + derive + record an existing bake
```

Snapshots are account-scoped: promote under the Freestyle account the
deployment's `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` belongs to, or the recorded ids are
unreachable from production.

It runs the stale-checkout preflight (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes), the bake, then `verify-devbox-image.ts`; only a
passing verify derives the sizes and writes the manifest, appending one
entry per kind and size flagged `defaultForKind` while demoting the
provider's previous defaults for those kind+size pairs (a sized promotion
also demotes size-less defaults: the ladder replaces the single-shape
image). Before writing it re-checks the manifest invariants and the source
drift invariants above, so a bake from another epoch or other sources is
refused rather than caught by CI. Existing entries are never removed, so
rollback is a manifest revert. The last stdout line is `IMAGE_ID <id>` (the
bake); `--out <json>` writes the summary with every derived id. Commit the
manifest diff in a PR; merging it is the promotion.

One bake, both kinds: the desktop bake promoted with `--kinds desktop,base`
(the default) appends one `desktop` row and one `base` row per size, both at
the same snapshot id, so the manifest serves the one devbox for every kind.
A promotion is idempotent per kind: promoting an image again with more kinds
appends only the rows it does not have yet (how a desktop-only promotion
gains the base rows without a rebake), and a promotion that would add
nothing is refused.

Promote both compatibility kinds together so the defaults keep sharing the
same snapshot at every size:

```bash
bun run devbox:bake:freestyle cmux-devbox-<tag> --out /tmp/desktop.json
bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --bake-result /tmp/desktop.json --kinds desktop,base --pointer-slug cmux-devbox-<tag>
```

A promotion that verified and derived but did not write (a refused write, a
crash after `derive-devbox-sizes.ts`) is resumed without re-deriving:
`--bake-result <json> --sizes-result <derive --out json>` re-verifies the
bake and adopts the derived ids (they already exist on the account, each
booted and checked by that run).

Pin the daemon for both with `CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL` (one commit's
`https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui/<commit>/manifest.json`) so the two ladders
cannot straddle an artifacts publish.

### Two promotions in flight

Two PRs that each promote a ladder conflict on `manifest.json` (both append
rows and flip the same defaults). Whichever merges second resolves it through
the writer, never by hand: merge `main` taking main's manifest wholesale, then
replay the rows the promotion appended (the `entries` of its `--out` summary,
or those rows copied from the PR's manifest diff):

```bash
bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --replay /tmp/desktop-summary.json
bun run devbox:promote -- freestyle --replay /tmp/base-summary.json
```

`--replay` performs only the manifest edit (`appendImageManifestEntries`: the
same append, clash check and demotion rule as a promotion, followed by the
invariants), no bake, verify, derive or slug move: the rows already carry
their verify outcome and derived ids. The other PR's rows stay listed,
demoted, for rollback.

## Bake and verify by hand

Each script refuses a stale checkout (`CMUX_BAKE_ALLOW_BRANCH=1` for
deliberate branch bakes). No local Docker and no daemon build are needed.

```bash
FREESTYLE_API_KEY=... bun scripts/build-devbox-freestyle.ts cmux-devbox-<tag> [--no-desktop] [--replace-slug]
```

The container recipe builds and self-checks locally (amd64; the desktop
comes up under `cmux-devbox-boot` during the build and is torn down before
the image is committed):

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t cmux-devbox:dev services/vms/images/devbox
```

Freestyle bakes on `freestyle/ubuntu` (4 vCPU / 8 GiB / 32 GB): VMs always
boot at their snapshot's size and resizing is grow-only, so the builder's
shape is what every cmux Cloud machine gets. Freestyle snapshot slugs are
reassignable; the printed `sh-…` id is the pointer to pin. Agent pins live
only in the Dockerfile ARG defaults; bump them together with
`CMUX_IMAGE_EPOCH` and the chatmux template. The cmux-tui pin comes from
the artifacts manifest at deploy time (`CMUX_VM_CMUX_TUI_MANIFEST_URL`),
never from the image.

Each bake prints a `next` command. The verifier boots one VM from the
snapshot, asserts the toolchain, the exact agent pins, `bwrap`, ghost text
under a tmux PTY, byte-identical baked files, the work user and machine name
(one uid-1000 account named `cmux`, no `ubuntu` left behind, a login prompt
reading `cmux@cmux`, `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` accepted), the
first interactive launch of `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` as root
and of `codex` as root and as `cmux` reaching the ready composer with no
first-run gate on screen (onboarding, folder trust, the bypass confirmation,
the custom API key consent, the root gate, codex's update picker and
bubblewrap warning; readiness is the composer text itself, polled and
bounded), and (when `/etc/cmux/image-stamp` says `desktop`) the desktop
contract (both ports,
RFB loopback-only, the session processes, the wallpaper on the root window,
one supervisor, `DISPLAY` in root's and the work user's login shells,
`cua-driver doctor` seeing the display and the accessibility bus, every
desktop file byte-identical), then waits for
the baked daemon to come up on its own, asserts the daemon contract (current
pin, running as the work user, identity bound to this instance id) and that a second machine from the
snapshot holds a different daemon identity, and deletes both sandboxes:

```bash
bun scripts/verify-devbox-image.ts freestyle <sh-snapshot-id>

Only after verify passes may an entry carry `validationStatus: "passed"`;
`vm-image-manifest.test.ts` refuses a `defaultForKind` entry with any other
status. Machines created from the old cmuxd-remote images cannot serve the
`cmux-remote` transport and need recreation on a devbox image.

## Checking a private connection

A healthy daemon inside an image does not prove that a particular Mac client
can connect to it. Check the client and image together before replacing a
snapshot to address an attach failure:

```bash
# From web/, using the Freestyle account that owns this snapshot.
# Load FREESTYLE_API_KEY from ~/.secrets/cmux.env without printing it.
bun run devbox:verify:private-link sh-<snapshot-id> /path/to/cmux-tui
```

For a Mac app, use its `Contents/Resources/bin/cmux-tui` binary. The probe
first requires the client's `wireguard-hub` capability; an older client must
be updated before a private-network image can be assessed. Rebuilding a guest
image cannot add that missing capability to an installed Mac app.

The probe creates its own VPC, VM from the requested snapshot, and temporary
WireGuard tunnel. It uses the production driver to confirm the machine serves
the trusted-carrier listener, dials it with `--carrier` (no enrollment, no
approval), reads the session snapshot through the private hub, then connects
again the same way. The report records both commits and the trusted-listener,
reconnect, and snapshot results.
The client need not match the image's older baked commit: successful protocol
operations are the compatibility check.

Keys and invitations are held in an owner-only temporary directory. Processes,
VM, tunnel, and VPC are cleaned up on success and failure; Deletion retries only explicit provider conflict responses with bounded
exponential backoff; only a successful delete confirms completion. Permanent
refusals fail immediately, and each resource cleanup has a 30-second deadline. The probe never opens
public ingress, installs a system VPN, or changes an existing machine. A
cleanup failure names the resource requiring operator attention and fails the
command. Run this alongside `devbox:verify` when validating a new image or a
new Cloud client.

## Terminal browser openers

Human authentication is installed by `guestBrowser.ts` through the provider's
create/attach/exec paths, rather than baked into the immutable snapshot. It installs
`cmux-open-url`, web-only OS opener wrappers, and shell defaults while retaining
Chrome/CDP/CUA on the guest desktop. The daemon's ephemeral `url-open` request
is scoped to the source terminal and needs a live Mac acknowledgement within
five seconds. Headless or older clients print the URL and return success.
The opener installation needs no image promotion. Automatic forwarding needs
the updated daemon and matching Mac client. Existing images keep their pinned
daemon until a normal image upgrade; those older daemons print the fallback URL.
