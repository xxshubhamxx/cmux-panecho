 * The devbox desktop contract: what a desktop-kind cmux Cloud machine promises
 * about its screen, shared by the image definition
 * (services/vms/images/devbox/desktop), the bake and verify scripts, the
 * Freestyle driver's port-open path, and the tests that pin all of them.
 *
 * The desktop is a TigerVNC X server (`Xvnc :1`) running an openbox session
 * with a tint2 dock, started and supervised as the work user by the
 * `cmux-desktop` systemd unit (desktop/start-vnc.sh, desktop/cmux-desktop-boot).
 * Two fixed ports carry it: RFB on 5901, loopback only and with no VNC-level
 * auth, and noVNC through websockify on 6901. The Mac app opens the noVNC page
 * (`CmuxTuiSnapshotParser.desktopPort`, CLI `cloudVMDesktopPort`), so these
 * values are a contract with shipped clients, not tunables.
