/**
 * Remote daemon state on a clone of a running machine.
 *
 * A fork or checkpoint is a memory snapshot of a live machine, so the clone
 * resumes with the parent daemon's whole remote state dir
 * (~/.local/state/cmux/remote): its Noise identity and authorization under
 * sessions/<session>/auth, plus the lifecycle fence, shutdown record and
 * socket locks beside it. cmux-tui refuses to start when a session holds a
 * lifecycle fence but no auth dir (it reads that as a legacy daemon whose
 * shutdown never finished). The boot supervisor (cmux-devbox-boot) deletes
 * only auth/ and connections/ on clone, so every fork strands its session
 * in exactly that state: the daemon crash-loops and port 1337 never listens.
 * The bake avoids it by removing the whole remote dir before its snapshot
 * (devboxParkDaemonCommand); a fork snapshots a live machine and cannot.
 *
 * The repair removes only sessions in that state. A live daemon always holds
 * its auth dir, so the repair never touches a working session, and it stays a
 * no-op once a bake's supervisor drops the whole dir on clone. The
 * supervisor restarts the daemon on its next tick, about a second later.

 * notices the clone only on its next tick. Neither the listener nor the
 * session state means anything until the supervisor has run its clone branch
 * (stop the source daemon, delete auth/, write daemon-instance-id), so the
 * loop first waits for daemon-instance-id to name this machine's metadata
 * instance id. From then on any listener belongs to a daemon started on this
 * machine. The repair runs on every pass because the supervisor deletes
 * auth/, the step that strands the session, only inside that branch.
