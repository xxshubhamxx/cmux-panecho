/**
 * The minimum-Mac-version list served by GET /api/mobile-mac-compat.
 *
 * cmux iOS consumes this list to decide whether a connected Mac (stable or
 * nightly channel) is new enough to talk to. `entries` are tiers keyed by an
 * inclusive minimum iOS marketing version: the tier with the greatest
 * `minIOSVersion` <= the app's version wins, and an iOS version below every
 * tier is unconstrained (fail-open: an app whose version the server does not
 * cover gets NO Mac version limit rather than an accidental block-everything).
 * The first tier starts at 1.0.0 so it covers the App Store lane and older
 * TestFlight builds. The tiers track the protocol milestones in git history:
 * Tailscale pairing became usable with 0.64.17, authenticated Iroh with
 * 0.64.20, and the rebuilt Iroh transport with 0.64.23. Every App Store
 * version (the `prod` build kind, starting at 1.0.0) now requires stable
 * 0.64.25 or the first published 0.64.25 nightly. Older TestFlight versions
 * retain the Mac releases they can actually use. In particular, BETA 1.0.4
 * build 20260817224846 is the last build that works with older Macs, while
 * the later INTERNAL 1.0.4 cut uses the rebuilt transport and needs 0.64.23.
 * Binaries built before the gate shipped ignore this list entirely, so
 * covering their versions is harmless.
 *
 * Nightly builds are versioned `<base>-nightly.<run id><attempt>` by
 * .github/workflows/nightly.yml, so build counters are globally monotonic.
 *
 * Devices cache the last fetched list per origin and fall back to a
 * compiled-in default when they have never fetched. That fallback
 * (`MobileMacCompatPolicy.baked` in
 * Packages/iOS/CmuxMobileShell/Sources/CmuxMobileShell/MobileMacCompatPolicy.swift)
 * mirrors the initial entries here; keep the two in sync when editing.
 * Edits to this file are code-reviewed; the route validates it at module
 * load so a malformed entry fails the build, never the client.
