/**
 * Transport-level startup benchmark (issue #12905): the same private carrier
 * the Mac app uses, driven headlessly. For each trial it creates a machine
 * through the production driver (`FreestyleProvider.create`, so the guest
 * shim and reporter installs are included), mints the attach bundle
 * (`openCmuxRemote`, the attach-endpoint's provider half), dials the daemon
 * over the WireGuard hub with `cmux-tui remote connect --carrier`, reads the
 * session snapshot, starts `bash -l` in the machine's workspace, waits for the
 * prompt, then reconnects once more and destroys the machine.
 *
 *   FREESTYLE_API_KEY=… bun scripts/cloud-vm/bench-private-link.ts [--trials N] [--size md] [--image sh-…] [--client <cmux-tui>] [--out <file.json>]
 *
 * The provider credential is read the way the runtime's client reads it:
 * FREESTYLE_API_KEY, or FREESTYLE_STACK_ACCESS_TOKEN with FREESTYLE_TEAM_ID
 * (source ~/.secrets/cmux.env).
 *
 * Scope: the transport path without the control plane. Production's create
 * also carries two inline `tls` edge rules (the coderouter alias and the
 * reflection alias, each routing to the deployment's API host with the
 * machine's model-plane token headers, services/coderouter/vmModelPlane.ts),
 * which need a deployment's secrets to mint. This benchmark's create omits
 * them, so its create timing excludes whatever the platform charges to
 * attach two edge rules, and the guest has no model-plane credential; the
 * control-plane benchmark (bench-vm-startup.mjs) measures the create with
 * them, as `provider_create` in the route's Server-Timing.
 *
 * Creates its own VPC, tunnel and machines and deletes them, including on
 * failure. Never modifies existing machines. Modeled on
 * verify-devbox-private-link.ts.
