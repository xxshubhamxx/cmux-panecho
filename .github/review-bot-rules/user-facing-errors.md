# User-Facing Error Messages

Flag production changes that add or materially change user-facing errors, alerts, command output, API error bodies, or recovery copy when they expose implementation details.

Establish the audience before reporting: cite a concrete path by which the changed text reaches a cmux end user (app UI, product CLI, or product API). A deployed service, HTTP response, or production file alone does not establish that scope.

Internal CI/build/deployment tools, artifact brokers, and operator-only diagnostics may name the services, providers, and configuration needed to diagnose or recover an operation. For example, an artifact broker telling CI to fall back to GitHub is allowed. Do not request provider-neutral wording for these surfaces solely because a vendor is named. This exception never permits secrets, credentials, personal data, or unredacted sensitive payloads, and does not apply when internal errors are forwarded to end users.

Fail when user-facing text includes:

- Upstream vendor or service names unless the user explicitly configured that vendor in the product UI.
- Internal provider names, provider-specific flags, templates, snapshots, manifests, environment variable names, database or migration details.
- Raw upstream error messages, stack traces, request ids from third-party systems, billing item ids, billing customer ids, or team ids unless the user supplied that exact id in the request.
- Secret material, credentials, tokens, headers, private keys, refresh tokens, session ids, or unredacted payload dumps.

Expected shape:

- State what happened in cmux/product terms.
- Give one or two concrete next actions the user can take.
- Put only safe, minimal diagnostics in `details`.
- Keep provider, billing, database, and auth implementation details in sanitized logs or internal telemetry, not in user-visible text.

Allowed cases:

- Developer-only comments, tests, docs, and operational runbooks that are not shown to end users.
- Existing public CLI flags or config keys in help text when the user asked for advanced configuration help.
- Generic terms such as "billing", "team", "Cloud VM service", or "Cloud VM state".
