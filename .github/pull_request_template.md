<!-- Before drafting or revising this description, read ../STYLE.md. Lead with the problem and the resulting behavior, keep it proportional, and delete any section or checklist line that does not apply. -->
<!-- First pull request here? docs/start-here.md covers what reviewers look for and what CI runs for you: https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/blob/main/docs/start-here.md -->

## Summary

<!-- The concrete problem, and what a user or API caller can do after this change. Explain as much of the mechanism as a reviewer needs to assess it; link deeper design or implementation detail. If this closes an issue, say `Fixes #1234` here. -->

## Testing

<!--
Say what ran, what passed, and what that establishes. Keep these apart:
- Tests added vs. tests executed. Name the command or CI lane that ran them; a green job whose tests were skipped is not coverage.
- Compiled vs. ran vs. checked live in a tagged build.
- Anything still unverified, stated once, next to the claim it limits.
The contributor verification ladder suggests the first useful check for each kind of change:

## Changelog

<!--
Keep this section. Write one line for the release notes, or `none` for internal-only changes (CI, tests, docs, refactors, build scripts).
Start with Added:, Changed:, Fixed:, or Removed:, then say in present tense what a user sees rather than how it was built. Leave out the PR link and credit; /release adds both.
Example: Fixed: Closing the last workspace no longer unfolds a collapsed sidebar group above it
Left empty or deleted, /release falls back to the PR title and flags the PR for a human to check. Don't edit CHANGELOG.md in this PR.
