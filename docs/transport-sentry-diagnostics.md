# Transport Sentry diagnostics

Iroh/transport failures are diagnosable from Sentry telemetry alone, on both
macOS (host) and iOS (client), without pulling logs off the device. Coverage
is policy-shaped, not a per-event guarantee: telemetry requires the SDK to be
started (telemetry consent on), error-event captures pass cooldown and hourly
budgets, and structured logs pass their own budget. Breadcrumbs are the widest
net (every retained transport event, attached to whatever ships next). The
pipeline turns the existing `DiagnosticLog` ring
(`Packages/Shared/CMUXMobileCore`) into three Sentry surfaces without adding
any new PII egress: the ring's vocabulary is fixed integer codes
(`DiagnosticEventCode`, `DiagnosticFailureKind`, ...), so the bridge ships
plain-language titles and decoded values, never error strings, peers,
addresses, accounts, or terminal content. Stable case names remain in
breadcrumb `event_code`, structured-log `transport.event_code` and
`transport.role_code`, and Sentry tags and fingerprints used for search and
issue grouping.

## Pipeline

`DiagnosticLog.setEventTap(_:)` delivers each retained event (on the ring's
drain task) to a `TransportSentryReporter`
(`Packages/Shared/CmuxSentryTelemetry`, target `CmuxSentryReporting`), which
emits:

1. **Breadcrumbs**: every transport event, category `transport`, decoded via
   `DiagnosticEventPresentation`. These ride on ALL Sentry events, including
   crashes and hangs, so any report carries the recent connection timeline.
2. **Structured logs**: the same decoded events as searchable Sentry logs
   (`options.enableLogs`), rate-limited by a sliding hourly budget so retry
   storms cannot flood the quota.
3. **Error events**: failures that cross `TransportIncidentPolicy`
   (`CMUXMobileCore`, pure and unit-tested) become Sentry events fingerprinted
   by `code/failureKind/transportKind` signature, with the plain-language
   diagnostic timeline attached (`cmux-transport-diag.txt`, the same report
   the `iroh_diag` socket verb and iOS Settings export produce).

The policy suppresses what an operator can already attribute (cancelled or
superseded dials, offline failures while reachability reports no network,
idle timeouts while backgrounded), coalesces repeats behind a 10-minute
per-signature cooldown, caps failure captures per hour, and escalates a
sustained no-success failure streak into one error-severity
`transport-outage` event. Environment (reachability, app lifecycle phase,
seconds since last success, consecutive-failure count) rides on every capture.
Only a user-usable outcome (`pairOk`, `rpcReady`, or `recoverySucceeded`)
resets that streak. Discovery, endpoint startup, socket connection,
authentication, and admission remain progress breadcrumbs because any of them
can succeed repeatedly while a later phase keeps the phone unusable.

## iOS Axiom outcomes

The iOS composition root also sends important fixed-enum events through a
dedicated `AnalyticsEmitter` to `/api/observability/mobile-network`. This is
separate from the PostHog product emitter. The authenticated route rejects
unknown properties, stamps the authoritative Stack user ID, and emits one
always-sampled `cmux.mobile.connectivity.latency` OpenTelemetry span per accepted
event. The existing server exporter writes those spans to Axiom. No Axiom
credential ships in the app.

Use `cmux.mobile.phase`, `cmux.mobile.outcome`, `cmux.mobile.failure`,
`cmux.mobile.transport`, `cmux.mobile.user_usable`, and
`cmux.mobile.duration_ms` for breakdowns. Each outcome also carries the stable
`cmux.mobile.event_code` plus the bounded `cmux.mobile.event_a`,
`cmux.mobile.event_b`, `cmux.mobile.event_c`, and `cmux.mobile.event_surface`
slots from the originating diagnostic event. `transportDialCancelled` includes
`cmux.mobile.cancellation_reason`, so a timeout-driven cancellation can be
separated from teardown or supersession. These slots contain only fixed enum
values, counters, durations, and process-local correlation numbers. They never
contain error text, URLs, addresses, identities, credentials, or terminal
content. `cmux.user_id` identifies accounts with repeated failure outcomes.
Latency monitors should group p95 duration by phase, transport, event code, app
version, and OS version. Sentry remains the immediate client-side outage alert
when the cmux backend itself is unreachable and therefore cannot accept an
Axiom upload.

## Wiring

- iOS: `AppCompositionRoot` sets the tap on the injected `DiagnosticLog`
  (role `mobileClient`). Consent is the same
  `AnalyticsConsentProviding` gate crash reporting uses; the SDK's
  `beforeSend`/`beforeSendLog` re-check it per envelope, and every outgoing
  event, breadcrumb, and log is scrubbed by `SentryEventScrubber`
  (target `CmuxSentryReporting`, pure core in `CmuxSentryScrubbing`).
- macOS: `AppDelegate` sets the tap on
  `MobileHostIrohRuntime.hostDiagnosticLog` (role `macHost`) after
  `SentrySDK.start`, gated by `MacSentryStartupPolicy` as before.

## Reading an issue

A transport issue's title is a plain-language event summary (for example,
`Transport dial failed (Transport: Iroh, Failure: Relay policy unavailable,
Attempt: 7)`). Tags:
`transport.event`, `transport.failure`, `transport.kind`, `transport.role`,
`transport.incident` (`failure` | `outage`). The `cmux.transport` context
holds streak counts and suppression counters. The attachment holds the full
ring as an oldest-first timeline with labeled values. Events use UTC timestamps
when a wall date is available and `+<seconds>` relative timestamps otherwise.
The breadcrumb trail holds the same event summaries, in order.
