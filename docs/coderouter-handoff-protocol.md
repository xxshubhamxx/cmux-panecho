# CodeRouter native handoff protocol

This protocol transfers CodeRouter authority from an authenticated cmux-native
process to another local/native process without putting a long-lived Stack
credential in the handoff. It is intentionally a bearer protocol: callers must
use TLS, keep the returned lease in process memory or an OS-protected store,
and never put it in a URL, shell argument, log, crash report, analytics event,
or Sentry context.

## Endpoints

### Mint: `POST /api/coderouter/handoff`

The caller **must** send the native Stack token pair:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <Stack access token>
X-Stack-Refresh-Token: <Stack refresh token>
X-Cmux-Team-Id: <selected Stack team id>
Content-Type: application/json
```

`X-Cmux-Team-Id` is optional when Stack has one selected team. If supplied, it
must identify a team the Stack user belongs to. The body is empty or `{}`.
Cookies, user-agent strings, `X-Cmux-Native`-style assertions, and route tokens
are not authorization for minting. A malformed native pair never falls back to
an ambient browser cookie.

The server reuses the current CodeRouter request-context checks: verified Stack
identity and membership in the selected team. CodeRouter has no hosted plan,
permission, or team allow-list gate. A successful response is
`Cache-Control: no-store` and has this shape:

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_...",
  "lease": "crh_...",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-13T..."
}
```

The lease has 256 bits of randomness and expires after two minutes.

### Exchange: `POST /api/coderouter/handoff/exchange`

The body must be exactly one JSON field, with no surrounding whitespace in the
value:

```json
{ "lease": "crh_..." }
```

Possession of a currently valid lease is the authorization assumption for this
method. Stack credentials are therefore **not required**: this is what permits
the authenticated cmux process to hand authority to a native CodeRouter
subprocess that does not have the Stack refresh token. Browser-cookie requests
are rejected; cookies never add authority. If a caller supplies either Stack
header, it must be a complete valid native pair; when present, the pair is
additionally required to resolve to the lease's same user and team and the
current identity and team membership checks are rerun. This optional confirmation is
method-specific and is not a replacement for the lease.

The response is the existing CodeRouter route-session shape:

```json
{
  "teamId": "team_...",
  "token": "crt_...",
  "expiresAt": "2026-...",
  "openaiBaseUrl": "https://cmux.com/v1"
}
```

`openaiBaseUrl` is built from the server's trusted
`CMUX_CODEROUTER_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` deployment setting, not from a forwarded
request host. Deployed non-preview runtimes fail closed if that origin is not
configured. Local non-Vercel development may derive it from the local request
URL for convenience.

The route token is returned only in this no-store response and is persisted by
the existing route-token repository as a hash. Unknown, expired, consumed, and
identity-mismatched leases all return the same `401 invalid_handoff_lease`
response; clients must not use that response as a validity oracle.

## One-time and storage guarantees

The database stores only `SHA-256(lease)` in
`coderouter_handoff_leases.lease_hash`. It has no plaintext lease column. On
exchange, a conditional update requiring an unconsumed, unexpired hash and
the route-token insert run in one PostgreSQL transaction. Concurrent exchanges
therefore produce at most one route token. If route-token insertion fails, the
transaction rolls back the consumed marker and a retry remains possible until
the lease expires.

The existing route-token table stores only `SHA-256(token)`. Billing
revocation marks outstanding handoff leases consumed before revoking route
tokens, using the same principal locks as mint and exchange. Repository callers
can supply a transaction-bound authorizer when a policy requires one; the
membership-only hosted routes do not add a billing gate. Account-deletion startup uses its deletion lock
to invalidate outstanding leases and route tokens; later mint and exchange
check the same durable tombstone while holding that lock. Normal route-token
authentication remains authoritative after exchange.

## Bounds and abuse controls

- Native Stack auth headers are bounded to 16 KiB each.
- Handoff request bodies are bounded to 2 KiB and must be JSON for non-empty
  requests.
- Deployed non-preview runtimes must configure
  `CMUX_CODEROUTER_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` as an origin-only HTTPS URL (for example
  `https://cmux.com`); no request or forwarded host is trusted for this value.
- Lease syntax is exact: `crh_` followed by 43 URL-safe base64 characters.
- The deployed route requires the existing durable Vercel Firewall rule
  `CMUX_APP_SESSION_HANDOFF_RATE_LIMIT_ID`, falling back to
  `CMUX_FEEDBACK_RATE_LIMIT_ID` for existing deployments. Missing or
  unavailable durable limiting fails closed with `503`; a limited request is
  `429`. Non-production local runs use a process-local 60 requests/minute
  backstop only.
- Responses are `no-store` and do not redirect.
- Mint traffic opportunistically deletes at most 100 leases older than the
  ten-minute retention window. Each mint adds one row, so normal mint traffic
  drains stale rows faster than it creates them without requiring a separate
  cleanup worker. Cleanup runs in its own transaction, so a maintenance
  failure cannot abort lease issuance.

Handoff telemetry adds only fixed operation/outcome labels to the current
CodeRouter user/team analytics identity. Lease and route-token
values are not passed to CodeRouter analytics, breadcrumbs, error context, or
Sentry; Sentry also scrubs both `crh_` and `crt_` patterns as defense in
depth.
