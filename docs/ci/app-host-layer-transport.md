# Opt-in app-host layer transport

The default CI artifact remains the aggregate `app-host-products.aar`.
An in-repository pull request with both `full-ci` and `app-host-layers` labels,
or a full-suite manual run selecting `product_artifacts: layered`, enables a
canary. The canary retains the aggregate fallback and also uploads four layers
and one small index artifact. Splitting alone does not reduce bytes: this first
canary deliberately measures the extra packaging and transport work.

The producer first unpacks its freshly packaged aggregate into an owned temporary
directory. Aggregate packaging is the existing owner of build-root symlink
normalization; the layered packer reads that normalized tree without mutating
the original build products. `CMUX_APP_HOST_LAYER_NORMALIZE` reports the extra
normalization elapsed time and outcome. Layer packaging has no default-run cost.

[`app-host-product-layers.md`](app-host-product-layers.md) owns the inner manifest
and local assembly contract. Every current consumer restores **all four** layers
(`app-cli`, `runtime`, `tests`, `diagnostics`). Embedded test bundles may be sealed
into their host app, so selective profiles require separate dependency and
signature closure evidence.

## Provider identity and fallback

After four successful uploads, the producer writes `app-host-layer-index.json`.
Its `cmux.app-host-layer-transport` version 1 schema contains:

- The exact repository, producer workflow run and attempt, run head SHA, checkout
  source SHA, and canonical toolchain identity.
- The canonical manifest's filename, SHA-256 and byte size.
- Each layer's exact GitHub artifact ID, provider ZIP digest and byte size, plus
  its canonical inner archive filename, SHA-256 and byte size.

The index and canonical manifest share one artifact. Compile-job outputs pin its
artifact ID and provider ZIP digest. Consumers do not search names or substitute
an origin because content happens to share a digest. Each read checks live
GitHub origin metadata, expiry, current producer attempt, and creation time.
Authenticated `gh api` downloads use repository/artifact-ID endpoints, preserving
the CLI's cross-host redirect handling; the index cannot supply fetch URLs.

The consumer verifies the provider ZIP before opening it, then permits only the
exact expected regular members and independently validates inner bytes. The
index artifact's entire ZIP is capped at 8 MiB, and each JSON file is also capped
at 8 MiB uncompressed. A combined index/manifest ZIP above that cap falls back,
even if each JSON separately satisfies its cap. Each layer is capped at 8 GiB.

Missing, expired, malformed, corrupted or wrong-origin layers leave the existing
aggregate destination untouched and emit `hit=false`. Local assembly publishes
only to an absent task-owned sibling using the canonical no-replace assembler.
Only a successful verified assembly updates the consumer's DerivedData path.
The current canonical app-host restore path stages package frameworks and runs
the product's provenance, checkout, and toolchain validation after transport.
Layer transport does not revive retired warning-log fields from older product
receipts. A failure in current semantic validation fails the consumer; it does
not turn into an artifact fallback or bypass.

## Canary receipts

`CMUX_APP_HOST_LAYER_TRANSFER` records each index/layer attempt, including failed
attempts: exact artifact ID, producer run and attempt, layer name, expected ZIP
and inner bytes, received bytes, elapsed seconds and result.
`CMUX_APP_HOST_LAYER_ASSEMBLY` records the all-layer assembly time and outcome.
These are whole operations, not isolated wire throughput measurements.

The existing flat download action and R2 broker keep their contracts. A verified
layered hit skips both flat transports. A layer miss first tries the flat R2
artifact transport, then GitHub if R2 is unavailable; all three routes enter the
same restore step and retain their inner validation. Retention stays
three days; this change deletes no artifacts and makes no same-digest origin
substitutions. Reusing individual layers across producers is future work because
it must preserve exact producer identity and the signed product tree contract.

Run the cheap contract checks with:

```sh
python3 tests/test_app_host_layer_transport.py
python3 tests/test_app_host_layered_products.py
bash tests/test_app_host_products_archive.sh
```

On macOS, the transport test includes a real Apple Archive pack/fetch/restore
fixture, and `python3 tests/test_app_host_layered_products.py` verifies the local
assembler. CI runs both before the native compile. Synthetic transport fixtures
do not establish hosted runner performance or full app-host runtime correctness.
