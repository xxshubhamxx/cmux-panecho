# GitHub Actions workflow inventory

Snapshot of the 89 files in `.github/workflows/` on `main` at `ea17450142`, with run data for 2026-09-15 through 2026-09-22 13:30 UTC.

How the numbers were collected:

- **Runs** and the ok/fail/skip/cancel split come from `total_count` on `actions/workflows/<id>/runs?created=>=2026-09-15&status=<conclusion>`. `action_required` runs are counted in the total but not split out.
- **Runner-min** is an estimate: the average summed job duration across up to 20 evenly spaced non-skipped runs, multiplied by the number of non-skipped runs. Queue time is excluded. It counts runner minutes, not billed minutes (Blacksmith and GitHub-hosted runners bill at different rates).
- **Last ok** is the newest successful run. For busy workflows it is taken from the newest 1,000 runs.
- **Owner** is the author of the pull request that added the file. **Last touch** is `git log -1` on the file.
- **Consumers** counts callers through `workflow_call`, required checks, and other files that mention the workflow file name.

Total estimated runner time for the week: **3,431 hours**. `ci.yml` accounts for 48% of it.

The required checks on `main` (ruleset "main: block force-push or delete") are `CLA Assistant`, `CLA policy guard`, `ci-status`, `Web complexity` and `web-validation`. Workflows that feed them are marked REQUIRED and must not be removed.

## Flags

**a. Experimental or canary workflows that have never succeeded, or have no consumer**

- `persistent-macos-compile.yml` (teamleaderleo, #13383, added 09-21): a pilot producer that has never run. It runs only when `vars.CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE` is set and the `cmux-persistent-compile` runner group is enrolled.
- `ci-artifact-canary.yml` (teamleaderleo, #13268, added 09-20): an R2 transport canary. Its one dispatch failed in the measurement step. It is the pre-rollout check for `vars.CI_ARTIFACT_R2_URL`, which is not set.
- Workflows that exist only on branches still appear in the Actions list: 15 `incremental-*` / `incgen-*` / `xcode-incremental-*` canaries (09-21 experiment branches, mostly failed), 7 `zz-13474-*` workflows, `verify-13450`, `verify-issue-13489`, `transport-v3`, `test-remote-connections` (29 of 36 runs cancelled) and `zz-mobile-terminal-package-boundary-benchmark`. None of them is on `main`. The entries disappear once their branches are deleted.

**b. Nearly all runs skipped (the trigger is broader than the job condition)**

- `persistent-macos-router.yml` (teamleaderleo): 6,887 of 6,927 runs skipped and none succeeded. It creates one run for every CI run and exits on the unset pilot variable. `workflow_run` has no narrower filter that fits the cohort selector, so the choice is to keep the pilot or remove it.
- `claude.yml` (lawrencecchen): 9,780 of 10,239 skipped and 7 successful. It fires on every issue comment, review and review comment, and the job filters for an `@claude` mention.
- `indexnow.yml` (lawrencecchen): 804 of 1,199 skipped. It fires on every `deployment_status`, and the job keeps only production successes.
- `merge-group-fail-fast.yml` (teamleaderleo): 11,324 skipped runs before #13476 fixed its trigger at 09-22 00:04 UTC, and none since.
- `cla.yml`: 3,905 skipped runs from `issue_comment`. It is required, so leave it alone.

**c. Duplicates and overlaps**

- `ios-testflight.yml` (every 20 minutes, CMUX INTERNAL) and `ios-appstore-upload.yml` (hourly, cmux.app) both run scheduled TestFlight uploads. About half of each one's runs fail (251 of 507 and 79 of 161). Together they use about 250 runner-hours a week.
- `testbox-broker-guard.yml` runs on every PR and every push to main (6,275 runs) because its header says "The main CI suite is dispatch-only right now". That is no longer true, so the guard could move into `ci-guards.yml`.
- `web-complexity-trusted.yml` and `cla-policy-guard.yml` together ran about 27,000 times. That is roughly 3x the PR events, because `pull_request_target` also fires on `edited`. Do not drop `edited` blindly: it also carries base-branch changes.
- `web-complexity.yml` and `web-complexity-trusted.yml` are an intentional pair: an untrusted diagnostic plus the trusted required check. Not a duplicate.
- `ci-status-fallback.yml` has been a dispatch-only `echo` since 09-18. The 3,697 runs this week came from before that change.
- `test-depot.yml` is named "Run macOS tests", and its own comment says Depot is retired. It is dispatched alongside `test-e2e.yml`.

**Other problems found along the way:** `release.yml` has not succeeded since 08-03 (both runs this week failed), and `iroh-release-gate.yml` not since 08-14. `tmux-corpus.yml` is `disabled_manually`. `ci-macos-compat.yml` fails actionlint on the unknown label `macos-15-intel`, and `test-ios.yml:21` fails actionlint with an empty string.
