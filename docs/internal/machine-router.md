# Machine router: invisible cloud machines for coding agents

Status: v1 shipped in the CLI (`cmux vm run`); this doc records the design and the path to the control-plane version that pairs with cmux-coderouter.

## Goal

An agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any open-source-model harness) should be able to say *"run this in the cloud"* and never think about machines: no ids, no capacity, no setup. The router picks the computer, provisions when needed, keeps warm state where the work is, and meters usage — the same way cmux-coderouter makes model credentials invisible behind a `crk_` key.

## v1 — CLI-side router (this repo, shipped)

`cmux vm run [--sync] [--pull <remote>] -- <command...>` routes over the existing `vm.*` socket methods:

1. **Sticky first.** A local binding store (`~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-bindings.json`) maps a work key — SHA-256 of the caller's directory — to the machine that last ran that work. A bound, ready pool machine wins outright: it holds the synced checkout, installed dependencies, and build caches. This mirrors coderouter's sticky `conversationKey → credential` assignment, which exists for the same reason (warm state is throughput).
2. **Then load-aware scoring.** Pool machines (persisted pool id list (`~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-pool.json`; the `agent-pool` label is only for display)) are tiered: awake and under 60% CPU (least-loaded first) → asleep (exec wakes them) → provision fresh → at the plan cap, share the least-loaded busy machine. Stats reads never wake a sleeping machine.
3. **Pool isolation.** The router only touches machines it provisioned itself — membership is the persisted id list, written solely by the create path, never the display label (which is user-editable). A machine the user made and named by hand is never drafted into agent work, even if it is renamed `agent-pool`; `--machine <id>` is the explicit opt-in.
4. **Deterministic contract.** `--machine <id>` pins, `--new` forces a fresh machine, the remote exit code passes through, `--json` returns `{machine, created, exit_code, stdout, stderr, ...}`.

Supporting primitives shipped alongside: `vm push` / `vm pull` (chunked, digest-verified file transfer over exec — works on any provider with a shell, no SSH), and `vm wait` (readiness gate).

## Why coderouter is the template

cmux-coderouter (`manaflow/cmux-coderouter`) already solved this shape for model credentials: Worker edge → per-`team:family` `PoolCoordinator` Durable Object → upstreams, with the control plane owning durable state and billing. Model coverage there is exactly the set we care about — **Claude** (Anthropic OAuth/BYOK/managed via `/anthropic/*`), **Codex** (`/codex/*`, OAuth), and **open-source models** through OpenAI-compatible BYOK families (Groq for Llama/Kimi, z.ai for GLM, OpenRouter for anything, plus Gemini/xAI) — so agents on any of those model families can be given the same machine story.

Patterns to carry over verbatim when the router graduates server-side:

| coderouter pattern | machine-router analogue |
|---|---|
| Sticky `conversationKey` derived from headers → body → hash fallback, always non-empty | Work key from agent session id → repo+branch → cwd hash (v1 ships the cwd hash) |
| Tier ladder: subscription OAuth → BYOK → managed; never a cooling credential | Warm machine → sleeping machine → fresh provision → shared busy machine; never a quarantined one |
| Headroom + expiry-pressure scoring, deterministic final tie-break | CPU/RAM headroom + "reservation about to lapse" pressure, stable id tie-break (unit-testable without mocks) |
| Health windows from response headers + adaptive active probing; 429 → exponential cooldown, repeated 401 → quarantine | Normalize provider capacity errors/exec failures/disk-full into one health state; probe on a traffic-adaptive cadence; two strikes → reprovision, not retry-forever |
| In-request failover with an exclusion list and an explicit replay budget | Re-route a *fresh* command to the next machine transparently; never silently replay a half-streamed one |
| Control plane pushes full versioned `PoolConfig`; DO lazy-pulls on cold start; usage flushes back batched + deduped, response carries fresh balance | Same split: Postgres owns inventory/quotas/billing, a per-team `MachineCoordinator` owns live leases and health, machine-minutes flow back as deduped events debiting the Stack Auth credit item |
| Credential never reaches the caller; only `x-coderouter-credential: <class>` is echoed | The agent may learn the machine *class* it got, never raw provider addresses or credentials |

## v2 — control-plane linkage (next)

The concrete wiring, in dependency order:

1. **`vm run` learns a session work key.** Accept `--work-key <id>` and default it from agent session env (`CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`, Claude/Codex session ids) before the cwd hash, so parallel agents in one repo get their own lanes ("chunking" across machines falls out of distinct work keys).
2. **Move the binding store server-side.** `vm.route` socket method → `POST /api/vm/route` with `{workKey, requirements}` returning `{machineId, created}`; the web control plane owns bindings and the pool, so routing is consistent across the user's Macs and future headless callers. The CLI store becomes a cache.
3. **`MachineCoordinator` per team** (mirroring `PoolCoordinator` per `team:family`): live inventory, leases with TTL, health windows, scale-out decisions against plan entitlements (`maxActiveVms`), machine-minute metering back to billing.
4. **crk_ keys become machine-entitled.** A coderouter key's policy grows `machines: {maxConcurrent, sizes}`; the gateway (or cmux.com API accepting `crk_` auth on `/api/vm/route`) lets an agent that already talks to coderouter for Claude/Codex/OSS models get compute with the *same* credential — zero extra setup, one revocation point, one usage ledger.
5. **Open-endpoint gap.** coderouter's upstream bases are hardcoded; when per-team custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints land (vLLM on a routed machine is the natural first case), a machine provisioned by this router can *serve* an open-source model that coderouter then routes to — the two planes compose.

## Non-goals

- The router never deletes machines to make room; at the plan cap it degrades to sharing and tells the user.
- No scheduler-style bin-packing of arbitrary jobs; the unit is "an agent's working session", which is what stickiness optimizes.
