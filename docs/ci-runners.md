# CI runners

> **Fleet route:** start at the hq [Fleet and CI: start here](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmuxterm-hq/blob/main/build-fleet/FLEET-AND-CI.md), then return here for CI runner selection, Xcode pins, repository variables, and the Blacksmith overflow switch. This file is the owner for those CI procedures.

## Rules that must never be broken

- CI is minis first. Blacksmith is overflow; do not disable an owned lane to
  make room for a dev build.
- Every mini must have every pinned Xcode from
  `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` and the matching `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_*` variable
  before it receives that pool's job.
- A dead Blacksmith pool uses the one probe-and-switch path below. Queued runs
  move only by force-cancel plus rerun; GitHub cannot rerun one job until its
  whole run finishes.

## Exact-head merging

`gh-merge-green` requires a completed, successful `ci-status` check on the
exact pull-request head. App diffs also require the completed
`macos / macOS compile admission` check. A missing, queued, stale, or
unsuccessful check is a refusal, and the helper prints the repair pointer.

When a known red check is safe to waive, pass a written reason with at least
eight words:

```bash
scripts/gh-merge-green manaflow-ai/cmux#123 --override \
  "ci-status is a known main failure; this exact fix addresses the failing path"
```

The helper posts that reason as a `merge-override:` comment, rechecks that the
pull-request head did not move, and then merges. It never waives a missing or
still-running check, conflict markers, or a changed head. `--main-fix` remains
the evidence path for red-main cmux-next fixes and posts its audit comment
before merging.

Every CI/CD job picks its runner from a repository variable instead of a
hardcoded label. Changing a runner type is a single repository-variable update
that takes effect on the next workflow run.

Linux uses Blacksmith. macOS uses Blacksmith cloud runners, plus the owned
glaeda minis for the lanes the pool picker routes to them. WarpBuild is paid overflow and is
not a steady state for any lane. Non-urgent macOS work also uses free
GitHub-hosted runners through the background lane described below.

**The table below is the intended steady state, not a live readout.** Repository
variables drift, and a stale table is worse than no table. For what is actually
set right now:

```sh
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Fallback baked into the workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LINUX_RUNNER` | every Linux job (`ci.yml` web/typecheck/db, presence, cloud-vm, nightly/ios decide jobs, homebrew, tmux fuzz) | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` |
| `LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER` | native ARM64 package entrypoint verification | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_15` | the macOS 15 default: `macos-compile-admission`, non-PR `app-host-unit-tests`, nightly helper and test-cache jobs, `iroh-release-gate.yml` streamed validation | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` | **pull-request** macOS jobs in `ci-macos.yml` (the app-host shards and `tests-build-and-lag` follow `macos-compile-admission`), `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml`, `ci.yml` (`claude-wrapper`) and `nightly.yml` (`refresh-test-compilation-cache`) | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` | test-only lanes that pick their Xcode by SDK and sign nothing: `test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml` (`auto`) and the `iroh-v2.yml` client | unset (see "Lanes" below) | each lane's own variable or Blacksmith label: `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` for `test-e2e.yml`, `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` for `test-macos-suite.yml`, `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` for `test-ios.yml` and `iroh-v2.yml` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` | `swift-package-tests` (SDK 15 release helper, then SDK 26 package tests) on **every** event, pull requests included, except attempt 1 of a pull request run whose picker placed it on an owned Mac (no helper build in that run; see "Pull request pool preference") | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26` | the macOS 26 image: compatibility jobs, `release.yml` and nightly sign/notarize, the disk-heavy `release-build` universal app, and the nightly compilation-cache warmer | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` | the larger macOS 26 machine: changed-revision universal Nightly app builds | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` | macOS GUI, XCUITest, and virtual-display tests (`tests-build-and-lag`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` | the iOS image: simulator tests, TestFlight upload, and `ios-streamed-validate.yml` (`test-ios.yml`, `ios-testflight.yml`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` | the repository-side switch for metered capacity; gates the four paid-overflow variables above (see "Break-glass" below) | unset (free capacity) | unset means the Blacksmith fallback wins |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` | non-urgent macOS work only: `build-ghosttykit`, the macOS legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts` (post-merge) and `cmux-tui-nightly` (on demand). See "Background lane" below | unset | `macos-15` (GitHub-hosted, free) |

A runner variable names a **machine capability** — an OS version, a GUI, a
simulator, both SDKs, or a larger instance — and every job needing that
capability reads the same one. It does not name the lane asking, which the
workflow already knows. `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are the
deliberate lane exceptions documented below.

Two capability variables may hold the same label today and still mean different
things. `MACOS_RUNNER_26` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` both name macOS 26,
while the latter requires the larger instance.

The paid-overflow gate and the runner-value policy answer different questions.
`CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` covers only variables whose purpose is paid overflow.
Other variables, including `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, are checked by
`scripts/ci/runner_label_policy.py` through the CI health report. Gating a free
pool would make repointing it at owned hardware require enabling a flag whose
meaning is permission to spend.

The pull-request lane also has a toolchain variable, set together with
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`:

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Falls back to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR` | the Xcode pin of the pull-request jobs that *select a pinned Xcode*: `macos-compile-admission`, `app-host-unit-tests`, `tests-build-and-lag`, the `nightly.yml` cache seed, and `ci.yml`'s pull-request build-input fingerprint | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` |

Not every job on the pool reads it. `ci.yml`'s `claude-wrapper` never selects an
Xcode, and the two `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml` jobs run
`scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` with no pin of their own, so they take the pool
pin described next.

### Which Xcode a job gets

Every macOS job that uses Xcode runs `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh`, and
`tests/test_ci_macos_xcode_selection.py` fails when one does not. The script
chooses, in order:

1. the job's own `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP` (the lane variables above), if set;
2. otherwise the version `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` names for the runner's
   macOS major: Xcode 26.3 on macOS 15 and Xcode 26.6 on macOS 26 today.

Either way it stops with one `::error::` when the Xcode is below the major in
`.xcode-version` (26), or when the pinned Xcode is not installed, instead of
building with the image's default. On GitHub's `macos-15` image that default is
Xcode 16.4. When a job's own pin differs from the pool pin, the job still runs
and warns, because jobs on one pool with different Xcodes cannot share
compilation caches or products. To move a pool to a new Xcode, edit its line in
`scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` and the matching `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_*`
variable together.

The deliberate exceptions are listed with reasons in the guard's `EXEMPT`
table: the Zig-only Ghostty builds, the macOS 14 compatibility lane, and
`relay-tls.yml`'s Xcode 16.2 job.

**CI routing is minis first, always. Never send a lane straight to Blacksmith.** Every CI lane tries the owned Mac minis first; Blacksmith only takes overflow. Do not set lane switches (`CI_E2E_OWNED_UI`, `CI_IOS_OWNED`, `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED`, `CI_OWNED_*`) to `0` or point `MACOS_RUNNER_*` at Blacksmith to "free up" minis. When dev builds are starved, the controller's lend drain gives them priority: after a foreground dev build waits 3 minutes, a lent mini stops taking new PR jobs for it (hq#956, hq#966; tune with `CMUX_CI_LEND_DRAIN_AFTER` / `CMUX_CI_LEND_DRAIN_PER_BUILDS`). On 2026-09-29 an agent flipped `CI_E2E_OWNED_UI` and `CI_IOS_OWNED` to 0 as a stopgap, which bypassed the minis and put UI tests onto Blacksmith macOS runners whose consoles come up locked. Fix capacity problems in the drain, disk eviction or worker supply, never by rerouting a lane.

## Lanes

Not every macOS job follows the same variable, because not every macOS job has
the same cost profile or the same urgency.

- **Required CI on `main`, the merge queue, releases and nightly** follow the
  `MACOS_RUNNER_*` variables above. This is the lane where a slow or queued
  runner blocks a merge or a ship, so it is the lane worth paying for if paid
  capacity is ever warranted.
- **Pull requests on `manaflow-ai/cmux`** resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`
  first, except the app-host unit-test matrix. Same-repository app-host
  shards are assigned per shard across `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15`,
  `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, GitHub-hosted `macos-15`, and GitHub-hosted
  `macos-26`; fork pull requests keep those shards on the Blacksmith 15
  fallback. Other PR jobs still use `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`; unset means the
  Blacksmith fallback. PR runs are cancelled on supersession by design, so
  they are the wrong place to spend elastic paid capacity. A fork uses the
  GitHub-hosted branch described below instead.
- **Test-only lanes** (`test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml`
  on `auto`, the `iroh-v2.yml` client) resolve through
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` first, and deliberately do **not** follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15`.
  Setting it moves every test lane off a backed-up pool in one edit without
  touching `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` or `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, which also route release,
  nightly, TestFlight and App Store signing. A GitHub-hosted value (`macos-15`,
  `macos-26`) is checked by each job's first step: the self-hosted fleet also
  carries a `macos-26` label, so a job that lands anywhere but GitHub-hosted
  capacity fails before checkout. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` does not follow it:
  a rerun must build with the exact Xcode the products were compiled with, so it
  stays on the Blacksmith macOS 15 pool it has always resolved to.
  Re-running one test to chase a flake should never reach for paid capacity.
  Both fallbacks stay on Blacksmith for that reason; `test-e2e.yml` falls back
  to macOS 26 because the macOS 15 pool's queue-to-start p90 was 83 min against
  1.0 min on 26, measured over 60 dispatches on 2026-09-22/23.
  `scripts/run-e2e.sh` then sends commits whose SHA ends in an odd hex digit
  to `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`, so the two instance sizes are compared on
  real focused-run traffic. It splits only that free default: a
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` value naming any other pool is used unchanged.

### Pull request pool preference

When `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` is `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, `ci.yml`'s `changes`
job picks one pool for the whole pull request run with
`scripts/ci/pr_runner_pool.py`, and every pull-request macOS job in the run
reads it: compile admission and its product consumers, `tests-build-and-lag`,
`claude-wrapper` and `remote-daemon.yml`. A run is
never split across pools, so the app-host product always meets the Xcode that
linked it. The run takes the pool in `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` with the least
expected wait and no queued release or nightly job: the queue its job joins
in rounds (queued jobs over capacity) times a job's length there (5 minutes
on 12vcpu, 10 elsewhere). Owned pools come first and take the run while its
jobs start there within `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` job lengths, whatever
Blacksmith's wait (Blacksmith is overflow), and while the queue stays within
machines x (1 + rounds). With the runners read live, that counts the busy
runners, the janitor's queue and the peaks of the runs of the last 10
minutes; without them, everything the runs holding the pool will need at
their peak. With live runners, a missing or stale snapshot no longer skips
the fleet: the owned pools are decided live, and a run none takes keeps its
default route. A pool's
capacity is set independently by the Blacksmith plan: 5 machines for
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`, 10 for `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, and 10 for
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15`. Each label's expected wait uses only its own
queued and running jobs, including the young-run charges used by the picker.
The macOS 15 pool counts one round more
(`COLD_ROUNDS`): the DerivedData seed exists only for the lane's Xcode, so a
run there compiles cold, 10 to 20 minutes longer, about one job's length.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW` | unset (on) | `0` turns the preference off; every job takes its `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` route |
| `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | preference order; only pools whose Xcode pin `pr_runner_pool.py` knows are accepted, and an unknown label turns the preference off |
| `CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED` | `0` | with `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS=0` only: a Blacksmith pool still takes a run with up to this many macOS jobs queued once it arrives |
| `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` | `1` | the most job lengths a run's jobs may expect to wait on an owned pool (at most `3`); within that they queue there whatever Blacksmith's wait, while the queue stays within machines x (1 + rounds). `0` is the kill switch and restores the old rule exactly: an owned pool only when the run's peak is free counting every run's peak, and a full Blacksmith pool rolls over at once |

The two macOS 26 pools share the lane's Xcode. A run on
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` builds with `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15`, the pool
and Xcode `main`'s own compile admission uses, and the build-input fingerprint
follows that Xcode. Every Blacksmith pool is sponsored, so cost does not rank
them; the order is speed first.

The queue comes from the queue janitor: each sweep publishes the per-pool demand
it already listed as the `macos-pool-load` artifact, and the `changes` job
reads the newest copy uploaded from `main` of this repository. Pull request
runs created since that sweep and still in flight are replayed through the
same rule first, each
filling a pool's idle slots (about 10 per Blacksmith macOS pool, less what is
running) before it counts as queued, so a burst of pushes spreads across
pools. The whole choice costs three API
requests. A snapshot older than 45 minutes, an API error, or any event other
than `pull_request` keeps today's route. The step summary of `changes` names
the pool, the reason, and the queue it saw.

A fork pull request gets no repository variables, so the janitor copies
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and the three settings above into the snapshot and fork runs
follow those: `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW=0` or a lane other than
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` keeps them on the Blacksmith macOS 15 fallback as
before. Fork runs never pin an Xcode (each job selects its pool's newest SDK
26 Xcode) and only use ephemeral `blacksmith-*` pools.

Owned Mac minis (fleet RFC cmuxterm-hq#573) join as class pools keyed by the
label glaeda issues to a dedicated member once it has verified the pinned
Xcode build: `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`, today `glaeda-std-xcode-26.6`.
The version comes from `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`, so moving that pin moves the
pool, and no machine carries the new label until glaeda has verified the new
Xcode on it. With `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED=1` the default order is
`glaeda-std-xcode-<version>` (48 GB minis), then `glaeda-light-xcode-<version>`
(16 GB), then the Blacksmith pools as overflow. An owned pool's capacity is
the online runners carrying its label when the picker can list runners
(below), else its entry in `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS`, and the janitor's snapshot
counts the jobs queued and running on that label. A pull request run puts several macOS jobs on its pool
at once, each on its own machine, so a run takes the owned pool only when its
own peak fits there by the expected wait above. The picker runs after the suite choice and counts
that peak from the run's routing: the Claude wrapper and remote daemon lanes
(and swift-package-tests when the run builds no Release helper, below),
beside the larger of compile admission alone or what follows it (a full
suite's seven app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag and cli-product-tests, 11
jobs in all; a changed-suites run's one shard; a CLI
change's cli-product-tests). The wait counts the jobs the janitor saw queued
and running there, and each run created since the snapshot at what it holds:
admission and its side lanes while it is younger than a job length (10
minutes), its whole marker peak after, when its shards exist. A run still
picking counts 3 machines. So an idle mini is never held for a shard that
does not exist yet; the shard joins the label's queue when it does, and
GitHub hands out runners in queue order. The peaks (the janitor's `committed`
and the markers) bound the queue. With `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS=0` every
run counts its whole peak against the machines, as before.
It is skipped when the snapshot is older than 20
minutes or the label has no slots, and it is never the fewest-queued fallback.
Fork runs and retry attempts never take it. While `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is off,
owned labels in `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` are dropped and the rest of the order is
used; an owned label for another Xcode than the lane's pin is dropped the same
way and named in the `changes` summary. An order left empty by that turns the
preference off. A pin path that is not `/Applications/Xcode_<version>.app`
names no owned pool.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` | unset (off) | `1` puts owned pools first and turns on the rescue below |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` | unset (no slots) | JSON, owned pool label to machine count, the `conforming_count` from `glaeda-mini-fleet pools --json`: `{"glaeda-std-xcode-26.6": 12, "glaeda-light-xcode-26.6": 2}`. A class (`{"std": 12, "light": 2}`) or a bare count (`12`, the std class) means that class at the lane's Xcode pin |
| `CI_OWNED_MAIN_RESERVE` | `0` | machines, and root runners, main's full-suite dispatch leaves free for pull requests; above 0 it takes an owned pool only whole (below) |
| `GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_ID` + secret `GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_KEY` | unset (snapshot only) | the org's `manaflow-glaeda-route` App. `ci.yml`'s `changes` job mints a token with `administration: read` for same-repository pull requests and main's full-suite dispatch only, on its ephemeral Linux runner, and the picker lists the repository's runners: the online runners carrying an owned label are that pool's capacity, and the idle ones its free runners, less what runs of the last `LIVE_WINDOW_MINUTES` took. That replaces the counts of `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` (which still turns a pool's root routing on) and the snapshot's owned counts and age: capacity, and which labels route (a pool's root, gui and side labels route while an online runner carries them, `routing_slots()`). Any failure falls back to them |

Main's full suite: `ci-main-full-suite.yml` dispatches `ci.yml` on main about
32 times a day, each a full suite. Until this change every one ran compile
admission and the seven app-host shards on Blacksmith (p50 wall about 37
minutes; admission 887 s on 6vcpu against 663 s on a mini with a 2 s queue).
The dispatch runs main's own code, so the picker places it like a
same-repository pull request, split and the `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` queue
allowance included, on the owned pools only: jobs that do not fit keep
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` as before. Its run holds 9 root runners
at peak (admission's, then 7 shards, tests-build-and-lag and cli-product-tests);
the Claude wrapper and remote daemon lanes route only for pull requests, so they
are not counted. Main's CI concurrency group
runs one dispatch at a time, so main never holds more than one run's machines.
Its marker, the janitor's `committed` count, the route replay in newer picks,
the owned Mac's kept build state and the rescue all treat it like a
same-repository pull request run. A retry attempt, a dispatch on another
branch, or `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` off keeps its route.

Each entry of `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` that is not an owned label or class with a
positive whole number of machines counts as none. A full label wins over its
class. While owned pools are on, the `changes` job raises a workflow error
annotation and a summary line for each such entry,
so a typo shows up on every run instead of quietly leaving a pool unused.

Root runners: compile admission, the app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag,
cli-product-tests and E2E jobs each hold one of a mini's canonical roots.
A class has `canonicalRoots` roots per mini (two on a std mini, root-1 and
root-2), and a compile takes any free one. The first `canonicalRoots`
runners of each mini are its root runners and carry
`glaeda-root-<class>-xcode-<version>`; the others are its side runners and
carry `glaeda-side-<class>-xcode-<version>`. An online runner carrying the
root label (or, when the runners cannot be read, a root count in
`CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS`: `"root-std": 10`, or the full root label) sends those
jobs to the root label, where they wait for a free root instead of being
refused, and the picker places no more of them than the root runners free.
The janitor counts a root job toward the root label and its pool. Without a
root count every job keeps the pool label. The CLI pipe, remote daemon and
Claude wrapper lanes always do. A root count above its pool's is an error.
With 8 std minis (two root runners each) and 2 light ones (one each):
`{"std": 32, "light": 4, "root-std": 16, "root-light": 2}`.

Warm affinity (`CI_OWNED_WARM=1`, off by default): an owned Mac keeps
compile admission's DerivedData, stamped with the merge base and the pull
request it built, and admission uploads the keys its mini starts from cheaply
(`owned_build_state.py warm-keys`: the merge base's sha12 and `pr-<n>` of
every canonical root, then kept seeds on a mini with one root, at most 8) as the `owned-warm-keys`
artifact. The queue janitor folds new ones into its snapshot's `warm`
(`owned_warm_state.py`): for each root runner, the keys of its newest
admission, with the runner taken from the jobs API rather than the artifact.
With live runners, the picker routes by cost (`warm_distance.py
route_admission()`): each online root runner that carries its static label,
which glaeda-cmux-runner gives every root runner at install, costs its
expected wait (0 when idle, else what its current job has left, from the
janitor's `running` and the fitted job lengths) plus the compile predicted for
its start: a kept build of the merge base, of the same pull request (a
re-push), or neither, by the pull request's own distance tier. The root label
costs the cold compile, plus the first busy runner's wait when the live count
leaves no root runner free. When the cheapest warm runner beats it by 30 s,
admission's attempt 1 takes `["<root label>", "glaeda-runner-<runner name>"]`
(the `admission_runner` output); otherwise the root label as before. A busy
runner is waited for only within `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` x 900 s, at most
600 s, which the rescue already allows every CI run's attempt-1 owned job
(`owned_pool_rescue.queue_seconds()`), so with the rounds at 0 only idle
runners are pinned. A job's root follows the free token, not the runner, so
glaeda's job-started hook gives such an admission the root with the lowest
predicted compile. No job writes a runner label, so the routing App needs
only the organization permission "Self-hosted runners: Read-only"; without it
the picker cannot list live runners and never routes by warmth. A warm runner
taken between the pick and the queue leaves admission waiting, and the rescue
moves it to Blacksmith like any other stuck owned job.

Distance routing (`CI_OWNED_WARM_DISTANCE`, on unless `0`) replaces the exact
keys with the distance glaeda's hook ranks roots by. The `owned-warm-keys`
artifact also carries `roots`, every canonical root's stamp (merge base, pull
request and that pull request's own app Swift files), uploaded after the warm
distance record adds them. The picker folds the artifacts uploaded since the
janitor's snapshot itself (`owned_warm_state.live_warm()`: the newest 4, one
listing plus two requests each, nothing when the snapshot is under 2 minutes
old), fetches the kept merge bases it lacks in one blobless shallow fetch,
and scores every mini's roots with the hook's near/far/rebuild tiers
(`warm_distance.distance_route()`, a mirror of the hook's
`warm_root_costs()` pinned by a parity test) plus this pull request's own
files. A mini's busy root runners hold its cheapest roots; the root label
costs the mean over the idle root runners, which is where GitHub puts it.
The cheapest runner by 30 s is pinned; ties go to cost, then the less
loaded mini, then the name. The picker's candidates, pick and predicted
seconds go to admission's record (`route.picker`) through the
`admission_route` output. A candidate's compile is multiplied by 1.19 while
another root runner of its mini is busy (an overlapped compile runs that much
slower) and by 1.43 on the two M4 minis, so compiles spread across minis
without `CI_OWNED_SPREAD`. A busy runner the snapshot does not list yet waits
as an admission that has just begun instead of dropping out.

When `keep` replaces another pull request's build, it parks that build in
`pr-builds/pr-<n>` beside the root's store (a rename; at most 2 per root, for
6 h; out of space, `keep` evicts parked builds oldest first, and
`owned_build_state.py evict-parked` does the same for disk tooling). Admission's
`check` for that pull request (`CMUX_OWNED_PR`) swaps it back in,
glaeda's hook ranks the root by it, and `roots` publishes it as `parked`, so
distance routing sends a re-push to the mini holding its own build.
On a mini with more than one root, the root that keeps the mini's only main
build stays at main (`holds_last_main`). A pull request compiled there is kept
in its PR slot instead, its next push adopts from the slot (`check`'s
`adopt_from`), and every other pull request starts near main's head.
glaeda-idle-warm refreshes that root first when main moves. That
start ranks far even when the pull request changes a package interface,
where every other start rebuilds the app.

The cost model is `scripts/ci/warm-distance-model.json`, fitted by
`scripts/ci/warm_distance.py fit` from the line every owned admission appends
to `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/ci/admissions.jsonl` on its mini (start,
distance in app Swift files, package interface and hot files, Swift units,
app rebuild, compile/admission/queue seconds, route). Refit with
`warm_distance.py collect <minis> > data.jsonl` and `warm_distance.py fit
data.jsonl --git <cmux checkout> --out scripts/ci/warm-distance-model.json`.

The compile estimates correct themselves. Besides each tier's p50 the model
keeps `tiers_by_start`, the p50 per tier and start kind (a kept build or a
seed) with its count, and `predict()` (and glaeda's hook, for a root's kept
build) uses a cell once it has 5 compiles, else the tier: a near compile from
a kept build ran about 90 s, one from a seed about 155 s, against the near
tier's 140 s. `scripts/ci/warm_model_refit.py` runs daily on mini-6 beside
ci-dash: it refits the tiers and cells from the last 14 days of admissions
(`warm_distance.py refit`, which leaves hot files, start_classes and
job_seconds alone) and, only when a p50 with at least 20 compiles moved more
than 20%, opens a pull request from `ci/warm-model-refit` with the errors
before and after and a time-ordered replay (`warm_distance.py backtest`). It
never writes main; without its token it leaves the patch and summary in its
output directory.

Spread-first admission (`CI_OWNED_SPREAD=1`, off by default): two compiles
(8 to 10 of a mini's 14 cores each) could take both roots of one mini while
another mini's root runners sat idle. When admission is placed on a pool with
a root count, `ci-macos.yml`'s `admission-placement` job, which admission
waits for on attempt 1, lists the runners with the routing App just before
admission queues (`scripts/ci/admission_placement.py`). It groups the pool's
online root runners by mini (the runner name less `-glaeda` or
`-glaeda-<K>`), picks a mini none of whose root runners is busy, and pins
admission to an idle root runner there that carries its `glaeda-runner-`
label. Warmth is the mini's, since warm-keys covers every root of a mini and
glaeda's hook gives admission the warm root: a mini with any root runner warm
for the merge base comes first, then one warm for the pull request, else the
run ID picks, so concurrent runs land on different minis and a mini with more
root runners is not favored. With no such mini it takes an idle warm runner
(merge base, then pull request), then the root label, so two compiles share a
mini only under pressure. The picker in `changes` only names the warm runners,
by tier (`admission_warm`): picking there
would leave the gap until admission queues for other runs' late placement to
take the pinned runner.
A pinned runner taken in the seconds before admission queues leaves it
waiting until the rescue re-runs the run, and attempt 2 never takes a pinned
label. The job adds its own runtime (a Linux runner, a token and one runner
listing) to admission's start.

An owned pool is persistent, which needs one more rule because GitHub never
re-routes a queued job: one queued there waits for that pool however long it
stays busy. Without the runner listing an offline mini still counts toward
capacity, and the snapshot can be minutes old. When the picker chooses a persistent pool, `changes`
uploads a `macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>` marker (the
janitor reads the run's peak and pool from its name), and the
`owned-pool-watch` job dispatches `ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml` (from `main`, with
Actions write) to watch that run. A run on an ephemeral pool starts no watcher.
If one of its jobs waits for a persistent runner longer than
`CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS` (default 90, 30 to 600) past the wait a CI
run's owned job may expect (900 seconds per `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` round,
since any of its jobs may queue behind runs accepted later), the watcher
confirms the
pull request head has not moved, cancels the run, and re-runs it. For main's
full-suite dispatch it checks main's HEAD instead: once main has moved past
the run's commit, the run is cancelled but not re-run, because its completion
makes `ci-main-full-suite.yml` dispatch the newer HEAD; a refused job on
main's run gets its failed jobs re-run whether or not main moved. A retry
attempt never takes a persistent pool, so the re-run lands on Blacksmith as a
whole, and so does a manual "Re-run all jobs".

An owned runner can also refuse a job: glaeda's job-started hook exits 1 when
the host is busy, and the job fails within seconds (or, for a GUI job waiting on
the mini's one gui token, within about 4 minutes). GitHub does not retry it.
The watcher treats a job on the persistent pool that failed within 360
seconds of starting, with no workflow step succeeded, as refused. It lets the
rest of the run finish (GitHub re-runs no job, not even one, while its run is
in progress, and cancelling the run would kill the refused job's healthy
siblings, as in run 36198335113), confirms the head has not moved, and re-runs
its failed jobs, so nobody has to. Only a run still going when the watch ends,
or main's full-suite run (a failed one would open main's red-CI issue), is
cancelled first. That attempt 2 keeps what passed and places the rest like
attempt 1 (below). Products built on a mini may be tested on Blacksmith, and
the other way round, which is sound only while both carry the same Xcode build: on
2026-09-24 the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu macOS 26 images all
reported Xcode 26.6 build 17F113 (jobs 107712770707 and 107710434810).

Attempt 2 is placed like attempt 1, whoever started it
(`pr_runner_pool.LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT`). `github-actions[bot]` re-runs a run only
after a host fault on one mini: this rescue after a refusal or a stuck queue,
and the failure attribution (`classify_failures.py`) when every failed job of
attempt 1 is a machine failure. Until 2026-09-28 every such re-run took
`retry_runner` on Blacksmith, where from 09-27 to 09-28 its 576 macOS jobs
queued a p50 of 9 and a p90 of 61 minutes, against 3 seconds and 8 minutes
for attempt 1's jobs on the minis, while the minis ran about half busy. Now:

- A full re-run runs `changes` again; the picker places it without queueing,
  the owned machines free now first and Blacksmith for the rest.
  `admission-placement` and `late-placement` run again too, and
  `admission-placement` skips the minis that failed a job in the attempt
  before (one read of that attempt's jobs).
- A re-run of failed jobs does not re-run `changes`, and a job it keeps
  (`admission-placement`, `late-placement` after a passing admission) keeps
  its outputs from the attempt before. A job takes those placements only in
  the attempt that made them (their `attempt` output), so a pin never names
  the mini that just failed; its owned jobs take the owned labels again (the
  gui or root label), where a runner that lost communication is offline and a
  busy mini's gui runner stops listening. `late-placement` runs again when
  compile admission does, and moves the jobs after it by the attempt-1 rules,
  Blacksmith's queue included (#15336).
- The rescue sweeper lists the unfinished CI re-runs (`owned_reruns()`) and
  watches attempt 2 like attempt 1, queue allowance included. Its re-run of a
  job stuck or refused there is the bot's attempt 3, which every owned-eligible
  `runs-on` sends to `retry_runner`
  (`github.run_attempt > 2 && github.triggering_actor == 'github-actions[bot]'`),
  so a host fault costs two re-runs at most. The failure attribution re-runs
  a machine-failed attempt 1 or 2 (`LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT`), or a person's
  attempt, so a mini that is online but broken (a full disk, a failed product
  restore) and fails attempt 2 again sends it to Blacksmith as attempt 3,
  which ends the chain.

Anyone else's re-run of a pull request follows a code or test failure and
goes back to the owned labels on any attempt, and the sweeper watches it the
same way. Main's full-suite dispatch takes the owned labels on attempts 1 and
2. Side lanes off ci.yml keep attempt 1 on a side label and every retry on
their Blacksmith default. `retry_runner` is empty for a run on Blacksmith, so
those re-run where they ran.

Compile admission on an owned Mac keeps its build state between jobs
(`scripts/ci/owned_build_state.py`) under `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/ci`:
the admission DerivedData, stamped with the canonical fingerprint (Xcode build,
canonical paths, file-system mode), and the resolved Swift packages. When the
kept DerivedData matches, the SwiftPM cache restore and the nightly seed are
skipped, and the compile, which compares inputs by checksum, rebuilds only what
changed since the last job on that Mac. The kept packages resolve with a fetch
of what changed rather than a cache restore. The first run on cmux11s spent 25
minutes on the ephemeral flow instead (run 36048804178). Any mismatch or miss
falls back to that flow, and a DerivedData over 40 GB is dropped. Only a
successful compile's DerivedData is kept, cloned right after the compile,
before the staging and packaging steps rewrite Build/Products. Only pull
request runs and main's full-suite dispatch keep or read this state; a main
run leaves the Mac warm for the main commit the next pull requests merge onto. Moves are renames on one volume, glaeda's host lock keeps one job
per Mac, and nothing is uploaded: an owned run writes only its own Mac's state.
The four steps are non-product recipe steps (`product_input_identity.py`), so
no pool's product key changes. Blacksmith and fork runs never take them.

The queue janitor treats an owned label as one more macOS pool. A stale pull
request run (category b: closed, merged or superseded) is cancelled there on
every sweep whatever the queue, which frees minis for current work. The other
categories cancel only while more than `CI_JANITOR_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` jobs queue
on a pool the run holds, owned pools included. With `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED=1` the
janitor also lists the artifacts of each in-flight attempt-1, same-repository
pull request CI run or main full-suite dispatch (one request per run, more only past 100 artifacts) to
read its marker's peak into `committed`. A run's other macOS jobs do not rule
it out: `swift-package-tests` runs on Blacksmith beside a full suite on an
owned pool whenever that suite also builds the Release helper.

`swift-package-tests` is an owned side lane (`swift-package` in `owned_jobs`)
only in a run that builds no Release Ghostty helper: a package change under
the compile-only policy, or a full suite with `release_build` false. The
helper needs an SDK 15 Xcode that only Blacksmith's macOS 15 image carries
(the minis have Xcode 26.6 alone), so a full suite with `release_build`
keeps it there (`pr_runner_pool.package_lane_owned()`). On the owned label it
takes the lane's Xcode (`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP` restates the runs-on condition);
every other attempt keeps the macOS 15 pool and pin. Like the other side
lanes it takes the pool's side label (`pr_side_runner`) when the picker names
one, so it never holds a mini's root runner. With it a full suite without the
helper holds 12 machines at peak (`MAX_RUN_JOBS`). On an owned Mac,
checkout's clean would delete every package's `.build`, so
`owned_spm_scratch.py link` points each one at a directory under
`/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/ci/spm-scratch/` outside the workspace, keyed
by a hash of `xcodebuild -version`, `swift -version` and the workspace path,
and SwiftPM rebuilds only what the change touched. The job holds its directory
with a shared flock until it ends, or 65 minutes at most (past the job's
60-minute timeout) if the runner dies mid-job. The mini's scratch stays under
24 GiB, least recently used first out, whichever runner or Xcode left it,
skipping the ones a job holds. Each directory's size is cached in a `.size`
file beside it and measured again only after a later job used it; a dropped directory is renamed to `.trash-*` before it is
deleted. `keep` out of space and `owned_spm_scratch.py evict` drop every
directory no job holds.

The side lanes (`claude-wrapper`, `remote-daemon`, `swift-package-tests`)
prefer the light minis. On attempt 1 of a same-repository pull request whose
pick is an owned pool, one side lane per light side runner
(`glaeda-side-light-xcode-<version>`) idle now takes the light side label
(`macos_pr_light_side_runner`, for the lanes in `macos_pr_light_side_jobs`),
and the picked pool counts the rest beside admission and what follows it
(`pr_runner_pool.light_side_lanes()`). The other lanes take the picked
pool's side label as before. It reads the runners live, so a light pool
with no side runner idle takes none; `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` no longer turns it
off.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE` | unset (on while `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is 1) | `0` turns the watcher off |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS` | `90` | how long a job may wait for a persistent runner before the run moves to Blacksmith; a CI run's owned job gets 900 s more per `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` round, the wait it may expect |

The watcher makes no API request while owned pools are off. A run on an
ephemeral pool costs it a few jobs listings until `changes` finishes, plus one
artifact listing.

The guard keeps the picker the only way onto an owned pool.
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` refuses any `glaeda-*` label in workflow
text, and `runner_label_policy.py` refuses one in any `*RUNNER*` variable, so
neither a workflow edit nor `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` can send a job there.
`check_owned_pools_route_through_picker` requires the picked label to reach
jobs only as `pr_runner` or on a `pull_request` `runs-on` branch. `ci-macos.yml`
reads those inputs for a `workflow_dispatch` on `refs/heads/main` too, which
the picker fills only for main's full-suite dispatch.
`CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` is the one variable that may name owned labels (the guard's
`owned` pattern, which must match `pr_runner_pool.OWNED_LABEL`), and the CI
health report checks every other entry in it against the workflow policy.
Owned pools stay off until `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is 1 and `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS`
gives the lane's owned label machines.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` does not move a lane on its own. A runner change and its
Xcode pin still have to agree, because `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` exits
non-zero on a pinned path that is absent.

Every job that consumes the compile-admission product runs on
`macos-compile-admission`'s pool and pins its Xcode. `app-host-unit-tests`
reads both from the admission's `runner` and `xcode_app` outputs, so it follows
any routing change there. `tests-build-and-lag` restates the admission's
expressions (paid overflow may move its non-PR runs to `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`
under the same macOS 15 pin), and `tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` fails when
the two drift apart. The cmuxTests bundle only
loads under the Xcode that linked it: a bundle linked by 26.6 (`macos-26`)
imports Testing.framework symbols 26.3 (`macos-15`) lacks and fails to dlopen
before running a test. `app_host_test_products.py restore` refuses a product
built by a newer Xcode than the job's, naming both, as well as another
revision, architecture or major Xcode. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` runs on the
Blacksmith pool whose macOS matches the source run's compile admission.

For the other pull-request jobs, the pin follows `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` through
`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`, and the two are set together:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b /Applications/Xcode_26.3.app
```

Unsetting both returns the lane to `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` and Xcode 26.3.

`swift-package-tests` deliberately does **not** resolve through
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` (the owned side lane above is the one exception, and it
never runs the helper steps). It builds the Release Ghostty CLI helper against an
SDK 15 Xcode -- it pins `CMUX_CI_REQUIRED_MACOS_SDK_MAJOR=15` for that step
and then asserts `HELPER_SDK_VERSION == 15.*` -- and only the `macos-15`
image carries an SDK 15 Xcode. That pin dates from Zig 0.15.2, whose MachO
linker could not resolve `libSystem` against an Xcode 26.4+ SDK
(ziglang/zig#31658, fixed by #31673 in Zig 0.16.0); the Ghostty submodule has
required 0.16.0 since 2026-09-17 and `install-zig-ci.sh` reads the version from
that manifest, so the original reason is probably gone. The SDK 15 assertion is
what still holds the job, and it has not been retested on a macos-26 image. So
it stays on `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` on every event, and the dual-Xcode guard in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` fails if it ever reads
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`.
`test_macos_jobs_use_lane_specific_xcode_pin_vars` in
`tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` keeps the pin on the same escape hatch as the
pool.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are escape hatches: leaving them
unset is the intended state, and setting one overrides just that lane without
touching required CI. That makes a rollback a variable edit rather than a
revert.

A job that also reports its own pool in an env value must read that value from
the same expression its `runs-on` uses, not from the lane variable alone.
`macos-compile-admission` puts `CMUX_PRODUCT_RUNNER` in the compiled product
contract and `tests-build-and-lag` validates `REQUESTED_RUNNER`; on a pull
request both resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`, so a job reading only
`MACOS_RUNNER_15` or `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` would stamp and check a pool it is
not on. `check_macos_runner_identity_env_tracks_routing` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` enforces that.

Every workflow exercised by a `pull_request` — including local reusable
workflows reached through `workflow_call` — has an explicit repository-owner
branch before runner variables are consulted. On `manaflow-ai/cmux`, existing
repository variables and their Blacksmith fallbacks behave exactly as above. On
every other owner, Linux jobs use `ubuntu-24.04` and macOS jobs use
`macos-26` from GitHub Actions: the image and Xcode (26.6) main compiles with,
so a fork's own CI can hit main's caches, which anyone can read from
`https://ci-cache.cmux.com`. Only the jobs that build the SDK 15 Ghostty CLI
helper (`swift-package-tests`, release and nightly), `plain-paste-worker.yml`'s
`macos-15` job and `ci-macos-compat.yml`'s macOS 15 row keep a `macos-15` fork
branch, because they need that image. Fork jobs set no Xcode pin, so they take
the pool pin from `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` (26.6 on `macos-26`, the Xcode
main compiles with). When a hosted image no longer carries that Xcode, a fork
falls back to the image's newest stable Xcode with a warning, so a newer image
Xcode is a cache miss, never a failure. Runs in `manaflow-ai` fail on a missing
pool Xcode instead. The self-hosted guard allows a literal `macos-26` only in this exact
`github.repository_owner != 'manaflow-ai' && 'macos-26'` form, which evaluates
solely outside `manaflow-ai`, where the fleet's `macos-26` label does not exist.

Scheduled, dispatched and push-only workflows take the same owner branch, so
a fork's own nightly, release, SDK and dispatch runs never wait on Blacksmith
either. Dispatch inputs that default to a Blacksmith label (`reload-build.yml`,
`test-e2e.yml`, `test-ios.yml`, `perf-activation.yml`) are overridden by the
owner branch; `test-e2e.yml` applies it to the pool its runner job picks. The
Blacksmith Testbox warmup has no hosted equivalent, so it is skipped outside
`manaflow-ai`.

That is the fork contract: **a fork needs zero runner variables and zero runner
provider setup to run its workflows.** Blacksmith is an
organization-level GitHub App; naming a `blacksmith-*` label in a personal
fork does not produce a useful error, it leaves the job queued indefinitely.
The fork branch therefore short-circuits before any `MACOS_RUNNER_*` or
`LINUX_RUNNER` value can select organization-only capacity.

A fork pull request into `manaflow-ai/cmux` runs with `repository_owner ==
'manaflow-ai'`, so the owner branch does not catch it. Any runner variable can
name a self-hosted machine, so every expression in the pull-request graph that
reads `MACOS_RUNNER_*`, `LINUX_RUNNER` or `LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER` first takes

```
github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.repository && '<Blacksmith fallback>'
```

as a top-level alternative, ahead of any variable. Workflows that an outside
contributor can start in the base repository's context (`pull_request_target`,
`issue_comment`, `issues`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`)
cannot use this branch: `pull_request_target` carries a write token, and a
comment event does not say whether the pull request comes from a fork. Their
jobs pin a literal GitHub-hosted label instead and read no runner variable.
The guard parses each
expression rather than matching text, so this branch nested under another
condition (for example the paid-overflow switch) does not count.

`tests/test_ci_fork_runner_routing.py` discovers every `pull_request`
workflow, recursively follows its local reusable-workflow calls, and requires
every variable-routed `runs-on` in that closure to contain a hosted fork
branch. Across every workflow, it also rejects a Blacksmith label that a
zero-configuration run outside `manaflow-ai` could select: each expression
holding one must start with the owner branch, unless the job itself is
owner-gated or the line is allow-listed there with a reason. The upstream branch still keeps literal Blacksmith fallbacks so deleting
a repository variable cannot silently change `manaflow-ai/cmux` capacity.

## Background lane

`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` moves macOS work that nobody is waiting on off the
Blacksmith pools. Every other macOS job uses the label selected for its lane
(with paid Warp as overflow), and pull request CI queues on those labels for
30-60+ minutes at peak.
The repository is public, so standard GitHub-hosted macOS runners are free with
unlimited minutes (about five concurrent jobs, 3-core M1, 7 GB RAM). They are
slower per job, which is fine for work that is not on a merge path.

A job belongs in the lane only if all of these hold:

- it is dispatch-only, scheduled, or runs after merge; never `pull_request`,
  `pull_request_target`, `merge_group`, or `workflow_call` (the guard enforces
  this per workflow);
- it fits 3 cores and 7 GB: scripts, a single package, a Rust or Zig build,
  uploads; not a full app or app-host XCTest build;
- it is not a timing benchmark or incremental-build probe, whose numbers only
  compare on the same hardware;
- it does not need a GUI console session.

Members today: `build-ghosttykit.yml` (Xcode from the image default, Zig
xcframework build), and the two macOS Rust legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts.yml`
and `cmux-tui-nightly.yml` (passed as `macos_runner` to
`cmux-tui-build-package.yml`; release and full-suite callers keep their own
runner).

The fallback is `macos-15`, never `macos-26`: the self-hosted fleet carries a
`macos-26` label and GitHub prefers a matching self-hosted runner. The
`macos-15` image ships Xcode 26.3 (macOS 26.2 SDK) next to its 16.4 default, so
jobs that pin `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` resolve there too.

An admin can repoint the whole lane with one variable edit, for example back
to Blacksmith if GitHub's macOS queue is ever the slower one:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
```

Leaving it unset is the intended state.

## Owned Macs for pull request compiles

The persistent compile-admission pilot (`persistent-macos-compile.yml`, its
router, and `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE`) was retired before it routed any
pull request.
Owned minis serve pull request runs through the pool picker instead; see
"Pull request pool preference" above.

### Side lanes on owned minis

Macos jobs outside `ci.yml` have no picker. Each is a side lane: its runs-on
reads `vars.CI_LIGHT_LANE_RUNNER` or `vars.CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER`, both
`glaeda-side-<class>-xcode-<version>` labels. glaeda puts them only on a mini's
non-root runners, so a side lane never holds a root runner a compile or
app-host job is waiting for.

- Light lanes (glaeda's hook classes them light: `swift test`, `swiftc` or
  `go test` into the workspace or a temporary directory, with no GUI,
  keychain, fixed port or canonical root): iroh-v2 `client`,
  cloud-command-deadlines `command-regressions`, terminal-hang-diagnostics
  `portal-reconciliation` and `phase-attribution`, cloud-task-local-tests and
  cloud-machine-tests `lifecycle`, relay-tls `diagnostic-presentation`,
  auth-refresh-tests, and a direct push or dispatch of remote-daemon.yml's
  macOS tests. Attempt 1 takes `CI_LIGHT_LANE_RUNNER` (the light minis, plain
  M4s that still beat a 6 vCPU Blacksmith machine), or `CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER`
  when it is unset; a retry takes the job's Blacksmith default.
- Std lanes: `cmux-tui.yml`'s macOS `lint`, `test` and `cdp-browser-smoke`,
  `reload-build.yml` (when its runner input is `auto` or the old Blacksmith
  default), and `app-host-test-rerun.yml` for products this repository's CI
  built on macOS 26. Attempt 1 takes `CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER`; a retry takes Blacksmith.

Both need `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` to be 1 and a trusted run: a same-repository
pull request, a push, a schedule or a workflow_dispatch (code from this
repository's own branches, by people with write access). A dispatch that
names another revision (reload-build, cloud-machine-tests, app-host-test-rerun
`ref`) takes an owned Mac only when that revision is the head of a branch of
this repository (`resolve-dispatch-ref.yml`'s `trusted_ref`), so a fork's
commit or merge ref stays on Blacksmith; cloud-command-deadlines only without
`source_ref`. A fork pull request
takes the Blacksmith default before either variable is read, and merge_group,
workflow_run and pull_request_target never take one. Attempt 3 and later
take the Blacksmith default. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml watches these runs while
`CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER` is set and re-runs a job that waits past
`CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS`, or is refused, on the next attempt's label.

relay-tls `system-keychain` (it changes the System keychain trust store and
selects Xcode 16.2) and plain-paste-worker (macOS 15 only) stay on Blacksmith.
Clear both variables to send every side lane back.

### Main compile probes

`main-compile-probe.yml` compiles one main commit that the per-push seeds
skipped, only when `ci-compile-attribution.yml` needs it to narrow a compile
break down to one merge (rare: a burst of merges with a break inside). It asks
for the PR pool's root label (`vars.CI_COMPILE_PROBE_POOL`, default
`glaeda-root-std-xcode-26.6`) and adopts the nearest main seed. A probe still
queued after three minutes is cancelled and dispatched on
`blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`. The per-push compile itself is
`seed-derived-data.yml`, which costs the canary no extra Mac time.

### Which macOS jobs may take an owned Mac

Owned minis run macOS 26 with Xcode 26.6 only, run same-repository pull
request code, and keep their home directory and caches between jobs. So a job
stays off the pull request pools when it signs, notarizes, uploads or
publishes (anything with signing, store or release secrets, or whose output
ships or seeds a shared cache), when it runs fork code, or when it needs an OS
or Xcode the minis lack. Everything else routes through a picker, with
Blacksmith as the overflow and ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml as the way off a busy
or refusing mini.

The trusted pool (`vars.CI_SEED_TRUSTED_POOL`,
`glaeda-trusted-<class>-xcode-<version>`) is the owned home for main's own
cache writers and builds: minis with no pull request runners, whose
job-started hook admits only a push or schedule run on main. The DerivedData
seed takes it on every main push. The nightly app compile takes one runner of
it first, `vars.CI_NIGHTLY_TRUSTED_RUNNER` (`glaeda-runner-cmux15-glaeda`):
runs-on asks for the pool label and that runner's own label together, so it
never lands on cmuxs-mac-mini-6, whose dev-build worker builds team code as the
same user. Either variable empty sends it to Blacksmith, which is also its
fallback. `runner_label_policy.py` refuses any other shape for either
variable. glaeda classes the job `isolated` (teamleaderleo/glaeda#1287), so it
never holds the canonical root a seed on the same mini waits for. Signing and
notarization are not on it: no signing run on an owned Mac has been proven,
and the retired self-hosted fleet failed `codesign` with
`errSecInternalComponent` (#6264).

## Retired: Tart VM fleet

The `tart-*` runner choices (`tart-canary`, `tart-dual` and `tart-small` in
`test-e2e.yml`, `tart-ios` in `test-ios.yml`) were removed on 2026-09-25.
Every Tart VM (the AWS EC2 Mac hosts, runners `tart-cmux-aws-m4pro-*`) was
offline, jobs that picked one queued for hours, and the hosts cost money while
allocated. The owned glaeda minis plus Blacksmith cover the load.

To bring it back, revert the pull request that removed it. That restores the
dispatch options, the runner identity steps (runner name `tart-cmux-*` and the
`/etc/cmux-tart-ci` marker), the `tart-canary` label in
`.github/actionlint.yaml`, and the fleet-label guard's allowlist for those
option lines. Then point the runner variables at the fleet again. See #14101
and #14106 for the earlier removal and its revert.

## Shared physical-host interoperability

The current required-CI policy continues to use hosted providers or owned
pools reached through the pool picker. Any future path that executes directly on shared CMUX-owned hardware
must preserve a separate caller identity, semantic workload request, and
machine-local physical lease.

Examples of callers that may share a host include GitHub Actions, `cmux-ci`,
developer/build tooling, direct agents, operator commands, and reviewed fleet
schedulers. They keep their own workflow state. The host-side execution adapter
owns fresh admission, resource ownership, bounded execution, and settlement.

A scheduler may select a candidate node. That selection stays advisory until
the node rechecks current drain/pressure/resource state and acquires its local
lease. When the CMUX controller already holds a machine or resource reservation,
the host adapter validates that reservation's owner, scope, generation, and
expiry, then binds local execution to it. It never creates an unrelated
competing reservation for the same resource.

Scarce local claims include native build lanes, heavy Linux slots,
project-native locks, artifact-publisher slots, and resident workspaces.
Participating adapters use one collision boundary for those claims. Runner
liveness, process names, and apparent idleness are observation only.

Execution receipts correlate the caller class and external request reference
with the semantic workload, opaque node identity/class, local lease generation,
result, and cleanup/settlement. Caller-private workflow state remains in the
caller.

Hosted/isolated fallback remains available when the shared host refuses local
admission or is draining, pressured, or unavailable.

## Blacksmith outage: the overflow switch

This is the only Blacksmith-outage lever. The 2026-09-29 manual variable
changes are recorded in the hq
[lever log](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmuxterm-hq/blob/main/build-fleet/observations/2026-09-29-ci-lever-log.txt),
but the probe-and-switch workflow below owns current recovery. Do not lower
`CI_PR_POOL_OWNED`, `CI_E2E_OWNED_UI`, `CI_IOS_OWNED`, or another lane switch.
GitHub cannot rerun one job while its parent run is still active; a run stuck
on a dead pool needs force-cancel and then rerun.

Blacksmith is overflow, so when it stops starting jobs the fix is to stop
sending overflow there, not to reroute a lane. `ci-cloud-overflow-probe.yml`
does that automatically (`scripts/ci/cloud_overflow_switch.py`). Every 10
minutes its `probe` job asks for one Blacksmith label and prints a line, and
its `watch` job, on GitHub-hosted Linux, waits for the probe:

- **The probe waits `CI_CLOUD_PROBE_MINUTES` (default 5, 2 to 20) with no
  runner.** Overflow goes off. The switch first writes the
  `CI_CLOUD_OVERFLOW_SAVED` record (each variable's value before, its
  failover, when and which run), then points the variables at their
  failovers: `LINUX_RUNNER` to `ubuntu-24.04`, `MACOS_RUNNER_15`, `_26`,
  `_26_LARGE`, `_PR` and `_DUAL_XCODE` to the std owned pool of the lane's
  Xcode pin (`glaeda-std-xcode-<version>` from `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`),
  `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` to its gui label, `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` to
  `glaeda-ios-sim`, and `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` to `1` so the gated ones are
  read. That is the lever pulled by hand on 2026-09-29. Only a variable that
  is unset or names a `blacksmith-*` label changes; one someone pointed
  elsewhere is left alone. Then up to 25 runs holding a job queued 5 minutes
  or more on a `blacksmith-*` label are force-cancelled (a plain cancel did
  nothing on 2026-09-29) and re-run, so they pick their runners again; merge
  queue, release and publish runs, and runs already on attempt 3, are only
  listed. If a variable write fails after the record is saved, the next
  stalled probe retries entries still at their recorded before-value and
  leaves hand edits alone. The run force-cancels itself whenever the watcher
  did not observe a started probe, including a switch failure before it could
  publish its outcome, since a queued probe would otherwise hold the
  concurrency group.
- **The probe starts.** If the record exists, each variable it changed is put
  back (a variable changed by hand since is left alone and named) and the
  record is deleted. While the record exists the probe asks for the label it
  names, not `LINUX_RUNNER`, which is GitHub-hosted then.

The lane switches (`CI_PR_POOL_OWNED`, `CI_E2E_OWNED_UI`, `CI_IOS_OWNED` and
the other `CI_OWNED_*`) are never touched: minis first does not change, only
where overflow lands. `CI_CLOUD_FAILOVER` (JSON, variable name to value, `""`
to leave one alone) overrides a failover, for example
`{"MACOS_RUNNER_15": "macos-15"}`; it may name only the variables above and
`MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS`, never a `blacksmith-*` label. While the record exists,
`check_repo_variables.py` accepts exactly the failover values it lists.

Writing variables needs a token no workflow permission grants. The workflow
uses the existing `manaflow-glaeda-route` App, with its ID in the repository
variable `GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_ID` and its key in the repository secret
`GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_KEY`. Without it the watch still probes, names each value to
set by hand, and fails. A manual dispatch is a dry run by default.

One Linux probe decides for macOS too: on 2026-09-29 both went at once. A
probe can start on a pool that is only partly back; the next probe, 10
minutes later, turns overflow off again if that pool still starts nothing.

## Break-glass: switch a runner type to a paid provider

Outside a Blacksmith outage (above) there is no automatic overflow for the
runner variables. If a pool is unavailable or its queue is too long, set the
affected variable to a paid provider.

Four runner variables exist to name **metered WarpBuild capacity**, so they are
read through a second switch that lives in this repository rather than in
repository settings:

| | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` unset or not `1` | `MACOS_RUNNER_15`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` are **not read**; every lane takes its free Blacksmith fallback |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` = `1` | those four variables select the pool |

Turning paid capacity **on** therefore needs two admin actions: a runner variable
pointing at Warp *and* `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW=1`. Turning it **off** needs
either — including a pull request anyone with push access can merge. Between
2026-09-19 and 2026-09-23 these four variables, plus the former release-specific
runner variable now folded into `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, pointed at Warp, so main and
the merge queue ran metered while pull requests ran free.

`MACOS_RUNNER_26` stays ungated because it names the ordinary free macOS 26
pool used by several jobs. Its safety check is the value policy described above.
Moving `release-build` onto a paid pool therefore takes one admin action:
repointing `MACOS_RUNNER_26`.

`tests/test_ci_repo_variable_defaults.py` fails if a workflow reads one of the
four paid-overflow variables without the gate, and
`scripts/ci/ci_health_report.py` reports how many metered runner minutes each
window actually contained.

```bash
gh variable set CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b 1   # enable paid overflow
gh variable delete CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux     # back to free capacity
```

```bash
gh variable set LINUX_RUNNER          --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404
gh variable set LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b ubuntu-24.04-arm
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_15         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE   --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_IOS        --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
```

Leave `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` unset.
They exist to hold the pull-request and manual test lanes on Blacksmith
independently of whatever the pool above is set to.

Check current values:

```bash
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

## Manual runs

`perf-activation.yml` and `test-e2e.yml` keep a `runner` choice input that
defaults to `auto`. Manual `auto` runs follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15` then the Blacksmith
fallback, so flipping the repo variable redirects those workflows. An explicit
manual choice wins over the variable; both dropdowns expose Blacksmith, Warp,
and `depot-macos-*` choices, with a Depot identity guard for GUI-activation
runs. These choices are available only through `workflow_dispatch`.

## Guard

`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` (run by the `workflow-guard-tests` job)
asserts that no job pins a bare GitHub-hosted runner (`ubuntu-*` / `macos-NN`):
every job must route through a runner repo variable so the overflow switch stays
a single variable flip. A GitHub-hosted macOS label may appear only as the
`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` fallback (`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND || 'macos-15'`)
in a workflow with no pull request, merge-queue or `workflow_call` trigger,
apart from the pinned macOS 14 / Intel compatibility legs in
`ci-macos-compat.yml` and `relay-publish-npm.yml`. It also asserts every paid macOS job references
`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_*` or a Blacksmith/Warp/Depot label so it can never silently
fall back to a free runner. Bare third-party provider labels (`blacksmith-*`, `warp-*`,
`depot-*`) stay allowed for deliberate single-runner pins. "Paid" there means
"not a GitHub-hosted free runner"; of the three, only Warp and Depot bill this
repository per minute, since Blacksmith is sponsored for this organization.
The CI health report counts those two. Keep new labels in
`.github/actionlint.yaml`.

The fleet-label guard refuses `tart-*` labels everywhere. Required jobs
continue to reference repository variables, so cutover and break-glass remain
configuration changes instead of workflow edits.

## CMUX-owned machine enrollment

Persistent CMUX hardware can be enrolled for repository-owned semantic workloads without becoming a direct required-CI runner. See [fleet-enrollment.md](fleet-enrollment.md).

The first reviewed role bindings are:

- `cmux_macos_native_build -> cmux.macos.dev-check@1`
- `cmux_linux_ci -> cmux.ci.guard@1`

CMUX owns those workload profiles and their pass/fail semantics through `scripts/ci/cmux_workload_profile.py`. Glaeda owns the machine enrollment record, candidate eligibility, local admission, and acceptance receipt that binds the exact canonical `cmux-workload-result/v1` bytes.

Enrollment does not register a GitHub runner or change repository runner variables. Required CI continues to use the policy above until a separately reviewed CI routing change promotes a fleet role.

## Direct physical-host runner boundary

Required GUI, test, Release, signing, and ordinary macOS jobs never route to
the persistent self-hosted mac-mini fleet (`cmux-mac-mini`, `studio1`,
`mac4-cmuxvnc*`, `cmux-austin-mini-*`). Those records can collide with cloud
labels and lack the isolated foreground GUI guarantees expected by runtime
tests.

There is no direct-host exception: no workflow names a mini's label or runner
group. Owned pools are reached only through `pr_runner_pool.py`, behind
`CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` (see "Pull request pool preference").
Every required macOS fallback still routes to the paid hosted path.
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` rejects any required-job or generic fleet
route.
