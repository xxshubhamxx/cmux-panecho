## Current fork changes

Current cmux pinned fork patch head: `b211341be`. It combines indented
hard-newline link continuations with the presentation-token runtime from
`24284c3ba` and is published through
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/124.
The corresponding universal ReleaseFast GhosttyKit archive is published at
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/releases/tag/xcframework-b211341be1ba902e772f57fc67c3e65d35205676-crashsubdir-cmux-crash-v1

- Summary:
  - Resolves each link to one exact value and exact terminal-cell set shared
    by hit testing, open/copy actions, previews, always highlighting, and
    Cmd-hover. Bounding selections are retained only for selection UI.
  - Recognizes conservative hard-newline continuations after URL/path break
    punctuation with 1-16 cells of indentation inside one semantic region.
    Period-ending rows, new rooted or scheme links, and ambiguous bare paths
    after `/` fail closed instead of merging unrelated rows.
  - Excludes indentation and trailing sentence punctuation from both actions
    and highlights. The built-in path matcher uses an unmapped match delimiter
    after joined candidates; custom end-of-input matchers retain literal
    behavior. Copy-link actions still honor the configured trailing-space
    trimming without changing the canonical target used for opening.
  - Applies matcher priority across overlapping candidate scopes, keeps OSC 8
    ownership authoritative, and maps both cells of wide UTF-8 glyphs.
  - Bounds cell, byte, candidate, and regex work; compressed pages stay cold.
    Regex work runs outside the terminal lock and stale snapshots are
    revalidated before results are applied.
  - Keeps the public surface config at 120 bytes and registers each surface's
    callback through a one-shot post-construction setter. Callback state is
    never inherited, and its userdata remains valid until surface destruction.
  - Carries presentation tokens through every backend. Metal uses exact
    in-flight slot ownership plus ref-counted renderer generations, so stalled,
    late, reordered, and post-teardown command-buffer completions cannot touch
    freed renderer or callback state.
  - Freezes each tokened Metal frame onto its rendered IOSurface while a
    replacement target re-enters the swap chain. The queued main-layer update
    retains those exact pixels, applies the size and teardown gates, and only
    then acknowledges the token; ordinary frames keep the allocation-free path.
  - OpenGL blits before its finish fence, preserves blit and cleanup failures,
    and acknowledges only after GPU validation, renderer cleanup, draw-lock
    release, and thread instrumentation. A reentrant callback may free its
    surface because delivery is the thread path's final operation.
  - Conflict note: future link matching changes must keep actions and highlights
    on the shared exact resolver. Renderer changes must preserve one-shot
    registration, exact-frame presentation, teardown cancellation, and final
    callback delivery together.

The presentation-token-only predecessor `24284c3ba` is published at
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/releases/tag/xcframework-24284c3ba4ebe79860d2b4e8d5d710fde2e1ebd3-crashsubdir-cmux-crash-v1
and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

### Tokened renderer presentation callbacks

- Commits:
  - `d303f9c89` (add tokened render presentation callbacks)
  - `a9d462403` (preserve presentation tokens across render backends)
  - `24284c3ba` (merge fork `main` at `bb30526cd`)
- Files:
  - `include/ghostty.h`
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - `src/renderer.zig`
  - `src/renderer/Metal.zig`
  - `src/renderer/OpenGL.zig`
  - `src/renderer/Thread.zig`
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
  - `src/renderer/metal/Frame.zig`
  - `src/renderer/metal/IOSurfaceLayer.zig`
  - `src/renderer/opengl/Frame.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds an explicit render token to the embedded render request and returns
    that token only after the selected target is assigned to the host layer.
  - Preserves the token through Metal, OpenGL, and the generic renderer path so
    a stale command-buffer completion cannot acknowledge a newer iOS replay.
  - Keeps the existing layer-size guard authoritative. A target discarded after
    geometry changes emits no false presentation callback.
  - Conflict note: future renderer refactors must carry the token through every
    backend and invoke the callback only after the exact target assignment.

The previous `bb30526cd` pin contains the merged theme, render-grid,
wrap-aware URL, and authoritative sprite-font shaping changes.

### Authoritative sprite-font shaping runs

- Commits:
  - `a6ca2cca0` (test: preserve sprite runs inside text)
  - `20d11e519` (font/shaper: preserve authoritative sprite runs)
  - `bb30526cd` (merge Ghostty PR #120 into fork `main`)
- Files:
  - `src/font/shaper/coretext.zig`
  - `src/font/shaper/run.zig`
- Summary:
  - Keeps special sprite-font resolutions in their own shaping runs even when
    a surrounding text font also contains the bidi-neutral codepoint.
  - Uses one coalescing predicate for both visual run-boundary discovery and
    logical run construction, so the two phases cannot disagree about whether
    a special glyph belongs to the surrounding text font.
  - Covers a box-drawing sprite between ordinary text runs. The test-only
    commit absorbs the trailing border into the text run; the fix restores
    separate sprite/text/sprite runs.
  - Conflict note: future bidi or shaper changes must preserve special-font
    resolver results as authoritative. Special fonts bypass CoreText and
    HarfBuzz shaping and render their own glyphs.

The previous documented pin `366c801e0` added wrap-aware URL matching across
semantic soft wraps and is reachable from fork `main` through the merged
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/118.
The corresponding universal ReleaseFast GhosttyKit archive is published at
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/releases/tag/xcframework-366c801e066c37695c2d9be4a6567662bd763ad0-crashsubdir-cmux-crash-v1
and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

The previous `b4b6d69c8` pin introduced an exact Ghostty CLI executable-path
contract for embedded hosts. That commit is reachable from fork `main` through
`67b388b73` and was published via
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/115. Its universal ReleaseFast
GhosttyKit archive is published at

and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

### URL matching across semantic soft wraps

- Commits:
  - `e0ab6113a` (test: cover URL links across semantic soft wraps)
  - `eee34d0f9` (fix: match URLs across semantic soft wraps)
  - `cbf65567a` (fix: scope wrapped link candidates by matcher)
  - `ee1e56791` (test: cover idempotent URL link finalization)
  - `30bd02565` (fix: preserve custom matchers across finalization)
  - `366c801e0` (merge Ghostty PR #118 into fork `main`)
- Files:
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/config/Config.zig`
  - `src/config/url.zig`
  - `src/input/Link.zig`
  - `src/terminal/StringMap.zig`
- Summary:
  - Keeps semantic prompt boundaries for path and custom-link matching, while
    letting explicit-scheme URLs use the complete soft-wrapped logical line
    when a semantic marker divides the line at a visual row boundary.
  - Assigns candidate bounds to each matcher so URL matching can use the wider
    logical line without weakening the narrower scopes for paths or custom
    matchers.
  - Keeps link hover, click, preview, and copy on one selection path; clicking
    any wrapped row yields the same complete URL.
  - Preserves custom matchers when configuration finalization or cloning calls
    `Config.finalize()` repeatedly, with focused regression coverage for that
    idempotence contract.
  - Conflict note: future upstream syncs must preserve the explicit-scheme
    wider scope, matcher-owned candidate bounds, and idempotent custom-matcher
    finalization together.

### Embedded Ghostty CLI path ownership

- `src/termio/Exec.zig` exports `GHOSTTY_BIN` as the exact CLI executable.
  Native Ghostty resolves to its running binary; an embedded host can supply a
  separate helper without assuming the host GUI executable is named `ghostty`.
- The zsh, bash, fish, nushell, and elvish SSH integrations invoke
  `GHOSTTY_BIN` directly. They install no SSH wrapper when an embedded host has
  not supplied a helper, so missing optional CLI support cannot break ordinary
  `ssh`.
- `GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR` remains the directory contract for the independent `path`
  shell-integration feature; it is no longer used to reconstruct a CLI filename.
- Conflict note: future upstream merges must preserve the distinction between
  the exact CLI path (`GHOSTTY_BIN`) and its PATH directory
  (`GHOSTTY_BIN_DIR`) across `src/termio/Exec.zig` and every shell integration.

The earlier fork history below includes terminal-owned scrollbar snapshots,
absolute row-space identity, OSC-boundary geometry, and compare-and-set
absolute-row restoration for notification scrollback replay.

The underlying compression, selection, and full-scrollback changes were
published via
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/96 and
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/99 and
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/104 and
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/105 and
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/106.

### Notification replay viewport authority

- OSC PWD actions carry the terminal scrollbar snapshot and row-space revision
  from the exact byte position where the replay boundary was parsed.
- `ghostty_surface_scrollbar` reads live terminal geometry without waiting for
  renderer publication.
- `ghostty_surface_scroll_to_row_if_revision` validates the row-space identity,
  scrolls, and returns the resulting geometry under one terminal lock. A reset,
  reflow, screen replacement, surface replacement, or scrollback eviction makes
  a stale request fail closed instead of scrolling the wrong rows.
- Conflict note: keep the PWD snapshot fields ABI-stable in
  `src/apprt/action.zig` / `include/ghostty.h`, preserve the PageList revision
  increments around row renumbering, and keep the embedded compare-and-set API
  adjacent to `ghostty_surface_scrollbar` during future fork merges.

### Upstream TLDR (`d560c645..7e02af879`)

- Terminal memory: idle renderer work now compresses cold scrollback pages,
  typically cutting their resident memory by 70% to 90%; unused page-pool
  backing is returned to the OS; the default logical scrollback limit rises
  from 10 MB to 50 MB.
- Terminal performance: pipelined PTY reads improve measured IO throughput by
  25% to 55%, parser/VT processing is substantially faster, and renderer-state
  lock hold time is reduced.
- libghostty-vt: adds compression scheduling APIs, color query/report APIs,
  Unicode width helpers, absolute-row viewport scrolling, and tracked grid
  references.
- Protocols and correctness: adds Kitty drag-and-drop parsing and fixes PageList
  capacity, ownership, bitmap allocator, cursor-height, and link-allocation
  edge cases.
- macOS: fixes IME preedit commits, quick-terminal sizing after display
  reconnects, and pasteboard handling for file URLs and multiple items.

### Fork integration and conflict notes

1. `src/Surface.zig`: kept the fork's latched Ctrl/Cmd-click semantics while
   adopting upstream's cached release position, drag guard, and renderer-lock
   ownership. The obsolete selection tests were dropped; the fork link-click
   regression test remains.
2. `src/renderer/Thread.zig`: kept cmux's iOS external-drain ownership and
   combined it with upstream's visibility refresh and idle compression
   scheduler. Desktop embedded surfaces therefore get automatic compression
   without a cmux-side timer.
3. `src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig`: used upstream's color-query response
   implementation because it supersedes the fork-only `a78fe53ef` patch while
   retaining terminal-stream APC handling.
4. `src/apprt/embedded.zig`: render-grid JSON snapshots now decode compressed
   nodes through `pagePreservingState`, reuse one temporary decode per page,
   and leave the original scrollback compressed. This prevents iOS snapshot
   streaming from undoing desktop memory savings. Replacement pages are
   acquired before the current page is released, so OOM leaves one valid owner
   for the scope defer instead of double-freeing the prior decode.
5. Fork CI keeps the `ubuntu-latest` aggregate-test fallback and skips
   upstream-only Vouch jobs outside `ghostty-org/ghostty`.
6. Selection changes and screen lifecycle transitions advance a terminal-wide
   atomic activity epoch. Renderer wakes compare the epoch without acquiring
   the terminal mutex, including for hidden surfaces, then invoke
   `selection_changed`. Accessibility callbacks can therefore read the
   selection synchronously without deadlocking or adding lock contention to
   output-heavy surfaces.
7. `selection_changed` is appended after every previously released C action
   tag. The old tail remains numeric value 64 and the new callback is 65, so
   existing binary embedders do not reinterpret later action payloads.
8. `PageListFormatter` decodes compressed history into temporary owned pages
   and frees them after formatting, so full `read-screen` and clipboard reads
   no longer make cold history resident. Temporary decode allocation failures
   propagate as `OutOfMemory` through Zig and C formatter APIs.
9. `ghostty_surface_read_screen_tail_vt` lets cmux preserve terminal history
   while replacing a completed remote-command surface. Ghostty derives the
   newest physical-row suffix from `PageList` pins and formats VT into a fixed
   byte buffer, halving the suffix on overflow so output is never cut inside a
   control sequence or UTF-8 codepoint. The formatter preserves SGR conceal,
   wide/grapheme cells, and compressed-page ownership. Upstream conflicts should
   keep this beside the existing embedded read-text APIs and retain
   `PageListFormatter.pagePreservingState` rather than restoring cold pages.

Verified with Zig 0.15.2: compression, formatter, selection activity, and
libghostty-vt compression tests,
the cmux link-click regression test, the `wasm32-freestanding` libghostty-vt
build, a clean universal GhosttyKit build, tagged cmux reloads `gcmp` and
`gsel2`, and live accessibility reads across select-all, endpoint adjustment,
and clearing.

### Previous pin

The previous cmux pin was `5ae712a89`, which added the bounded VT screen-tail
export on top of `e215e78bf`. Before that, `1ae98c991` was superseded by
`e215e78bf` after
full scrollback formatting was changed to preserve compressed storage and
selection notifications moved to a lock-free terminal-wide epoch. The initial
compression merge for this update was `870ed36f9`; it was superseded by
`4117298e4` after the preserved-page OOM ownership fix, by `bdf4baa80` after
the selection notification callback fix, then by `1ae98c991` after preserving
public action tag values. The fork's prior `main` head was
`cc31d54ee`, which merged upstream through `d560c645`; both histories are
ancestors of `e215e78bf`.

### Earlier pin

Previous cmux pinned fork head: `541e5e89d`, which merges the render-grid span
preservation head `1b454eb99` from manaflow-ai/ghostty#89 with the
Arabic/Hebrew RTL shaping head `7a5179843` from manaflow-ai/ghostty#88.

The render-grid change keeps wide or grapheme-backed cells in their own
`cmux.render-grid.v1` spans so mobile replay receives the producer's exact
start column and `cell_width` instead of inferring per-grapheme columns from an
aggregate same-style span.

The RTL series is based on ghostty-org/ghostty#11079 and adds the `itijah` bidi
resolver, extends the shared `uucode` tables with bidi fields, resolves visual
shaping runs per row, sets RTL shaping direction for CoreText/HarfBuzz, and
anchors Arabic combining marks/tashkeel to the correct base cluster. The
cmux-only follow-up commit adapts the new shaper tests to this pinned fork's
`vtStream().nextSlice` void-returning API. The RTL series was validated locally
with:

```bash
cd ghostty
zig build test -Dapp-runtime=none -Demit-macos-app=false -Demit-xcframework=false -Dtest-filter=arabic
zig build test -Dapp-runtime=none -Demit-macos-app=false -Demit-xcframework=false -Dtest-filter=hebrew

and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

### 0a) lib-vt OSC color query replies

- Files:
  - `src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds OSC 4/10/11/12 query replies to the non-termio `TerminalStream` path used by libghostty-vt consumers.
  - Reports known palette/default/override colors through the existing `write_pty` effect in 16-bit `rgb:xxxx/xxxx/xxxx` form, preserving the query's BEL or ST terminator.
  - Leaves unknown dynamic colors unanswered so embedders that have not supplied host defaults preserve the previous silent behavior.
  - Upstreamability: mirrors the existing termio stream handler behavior, but scoped to lib-vt's callback-based reply mechanism.

The previous cmux pinned fork head was `1b454eb99`, which retained the
Darwin-only `ghostty_surface_set_renderer_realized` C API (a
`display_realized` renderer-thread mailbox message that drives
`displayUnrealized()`/`displayRealized()`) on top of `5697db81`. cmux uses it to
release an occluded terminal's GPU renderer resources (Metal swap chain /
IOSurface) while keeping its PTY alive, then rebuild them on re-show. The API
returns whether the message was enqueued so the embedder only advances its
realize/unrealize mirror state on success. The push is `.instant`
(non-blocking) so it never stalls the embedder's main thread waiting on the
renderer. See manaflow-ai/ghostty branch `feat-renderer-realized-offscreen`,
the copy-mode read branches `issue-6170-surface-read-screen-text-main` and
`issue-6170-screen-clipboard-text`, and
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4607. The corresponding prebuilt

and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`. The `1b454eb99` render-grid
head's corresponding prebuilt archive is published at
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/releases/tag/xcframework-1b454eb999d6f4aea28a18ca0e1500c0477383ef-crashsubdir-cmux-crash-v1

and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

The prior head was refreshed from upstream `main` on May 1, 2026.
Earlier cmux pinned fork head: `34cbf180d`, merging the surface registry
serialization for https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5458 (`e5c962a72`,
landed on cmux `main`) into the iOS render bounded-acquire line (`f78189ac1`)
combined with the cmd-click link refresh under mouse reporting (`df789cd4b`,
manaflow-ai/ghostty#71 and PRs #74 through #79) for
https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5128. This keeps the previous head's
manual embedded IO patch in https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/53,
the Metal renderer row rebuild guard for https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/3369,
the URL/path regex bound for spaced file paths followed by prose, and the iOS
render serial-queue bounded acquire fix from manaflow-ai/ghostty#80. This head
keeps the cmux theme picker hooks, exposes the manual surface IO needed by
libghostty iOS clients, bounds shaped glyph iteration during IME/preedit row
rebuilds, prevents Cmd-hover from highlighting normal sentence text after a file
path, and lets Cmd-click open links even while a mouse-reporting alt-screen TUI
(Claude Code, Codex) has grabbed the mouse.
It also supports Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P in the cmux theme picker.

and pinned in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

### 0) Render-grid span column preservation for mobile replay

- Commit: `79b5bb6ee` (render-grid: split nontrivial cells into own spans)
- PR: https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/89
- Files:
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
- Summary:
  - Forces wide cells and cells with attached grapheme data to close the active
    render-grid span before and after emission.
  - Preserves exact producer columns for mixed-width same-style text, so iOS
    replay no longer has to reconstruct per-grapheme widths from one aggregate
    `cell_width`.
  - Conflict note: this sits in the render-grid JSON encoder's row/cell loop,
    near the span coalescing logic and `appendRenderGridCellText`.

### 1) macOS display link restart on display changes

- Commit: `05cf31b38` (macos: restart display link after display ID change)
- Files:
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
- Summary:
  - Restarts the CVDisplayLink when `setMacOSDisplayID` updates the current CGDisplay.
  - Prevents a rare state where vsync is "running" but no callbacks arrive, which can look like a frozen surface until focus/occlusion changes.

### 2) macOS resize stale-frame mitigation

The resize commits are grouped by feature because they touch the same stale-frame replay path and
tend to conflict together during rebases.

- Commits:
  - `a3588ac53` (macos: reduce transient blank/scaled frames during resize)
  - `9ba54a68c` (macos: keep top-left gravity for stale-frame replay)
- Files:
  - `pkg/macos/animation.zig`
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - `src/renderer/Metal.zig`
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
  - `src/renderer/metal/IOSurfaceLayer.zig`
- Summary:
  - Replays the last rendered frame during resize and keeps its geometry anchored correctly.
  - Reduces transient blank or scaled frames while a macOS window is being resized.

### 3) OSC 99 (kitty) notification parser

- Commits:
  - `2033ffebc` (Add OSC 99 notification parser)
  - `a75615992` (Fix OSC 99 parser for upstream API changes)
- Files:
  - `src/terminal/osc.zig`
  - `src/terminal/osc/parsers.zig`
  - `src/terminal/osc/parsers/kitty_notification.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a parser for kitty OSC 99 notifications and wires it into the OSC dispatcher.
  - Adapts the parser to upstream's newer capture API so the cmux OSC 99 hook survives the March 30 upstream sync.

### 4) cmux theme picker helper hooks

- Commits:
  - `66ff6ec4d` (Add cmux theme picker helper hooks)
  - `aa650937d` (Fix cmux theme picker preview writes)
  - `89d3612c9` (Improve cmux theme picker footer contrast)
  - `0dc979889` (Respect system theme in cmux picker)
  - `d9e0ab512` (Skip theme detection in cmux picker)
  - `042cbaaab` (Match Ghostty theme picker startup)
  - `eb34bcdd6` (Harden cmux theme override writes)
  - `04ec69173` (Apply highlighted cmux theme on Enter)
  - `4265d3428` (Apply cmux theme from picker search)
  - `176bd550f` (Add ctrl navigation to cmux theme picker)
- Files:
  - `build.zig`
  - `src/cli/list_themes.zig`
  - `src/main_ghostty.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a `zig build cli-helper` step so cmux can bundle Ghostty's CLI helper binary on macOS.
  - Lets `+list-themes` switch into a cmux-managed mode via env vars, writing the cmux theme override file and posting the existing cmux reload notification for live app-wide preview.
  - Keeps the preview UI readable in light mode, matches upstream picker startup behavior, and hardens writes to the cmux-managed theme override file.
  - Restores Enter as the cmux apply action by writing the currently highlighted theme before the picker exits.
  - Applies the highlighted search result when Enter is pressed from search mode in cmux-managed picker sessions.
  - Supports Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P as one-row down/up navigation in cmux-managed picker sessions.

### 5) Color scheme mode 2031 reporting

- Commits:
  - `2be58ee0e` (Fix DECRPM mode 2031 reporting wrong color scheme)
  - `74709c29b` (Send initial color scheme report when mode 2031 is enabled)
- Files:
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/termio/stream_handler.zig`
- Summary:
  - Keeps Ghostty's mode 2031 color-scheme response aligned with the surface's actual conditional state after config reloads.
  - Sends the initial DSR 997 report as soon as mode 2031 is enabled, which cmux relies on for immediate color-scheme awareness.

### 6) Keyboard copy mode selection C API

- Commits:
  - `0b231db94` (Re-export cmux selection APIs removed from upstream)
  - `46bd03a7` (surface: add absolute screen row text read)
  - `edad0cfec` (surface: format screen row clipboard text)
  - `e81fb65f` (surface: bound screen clipboard text formatting)
- Files:
  - `include/ghostty.h`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - `src/Surface.zig`
- Summary:
  - Restores `ghostty_surface_select_cursor_cell` and `ghostty_surface_clear_selection`.
  - Keeps cmux keyboard copy mode working against the refreshed Ghostty base after upstream removed those exports.

### 7) macos-background-from-layer config flag

- Commits:
  - `ae3cc5d29` (Restore macOS layer background hook)
  - `aa28e1bcb` (Add macos-background-from-layer config flag)
  - `1a01b36d9` (Skip fullscreen bg draw call in layer-background mode)
  - `82e20630b` (Preserve bg images in layer background mode)
  - `465a9a621` (Restore bg-image alpha in layer background mode)
- Files:
  - `src/config/Config.zig`
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a `macos-background-from-layer` bool config (default false).
  - When true, sets `bg_color[3] = 0` in the per-frame uniform update so the Metal renderer skips the full-screen background fill.
  - Allows the host app to provide the terminal background via `CALayer.backgroundColor` for instant coverage during view resizes, avoiding alpha double-stacking.
  - Replays the layer-background restore on top of the refreshed Ghostty base so cmux keeps the resize-coverage fix after the upstream sync.

### 8) TerminalStream kitty graphics APC handling

- Commit: `a8e92c9c5` (terminal: add APC handler to stream_terminal)
- Files:
  - `src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig`
- Summary:
  - Wires `.apc_start`, `.apc_put`, and `.apc_end` through the shared APC parser in `TerminalStream`.
  - Restores kitty graphics execution and APC OK/error replies for the non-termio stream path used by cmux/libghostty integrations.

### 9) Config load string C API

- Commit: `f7880c473` (Add config load string C API)
- Files:
  - `include/ghostty.h`
  - `src/config/CApi.zig`
  - `src/config/Config.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a C API for loading Ghostty config from an in-memory string.
  - Lets cmux parse generated or override config without materializing a separate config file first.

### 10) Manual embedded IO for libghostty iOS

- Commit: `22fa801f8` (Expose manual embedded IO for iOS)
- PR: https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/53
- Files:
  - `include/ghostty.h`
  - `src/Surface.zig`
  - `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - `src/input.zig`
  - `src/input/text.zig`
  - `src/renderer/Thread.zig`
  - `src/termio.zig`
  - `src/termio/Manual.zig`
  - `src/termio/Termio.zig`
  - `src/termio/backend.zig`
- Summary:
  - Exposes `GHOSTTY_SURFACE_IO_MANUAL`, `io_write_cb`, `ghostty_surface_process_output`,
    `ghostty_surface_text_input`, and `ghostty_surface_render_now` through the embedded C API.
  - Wires the existing manual termio backend into embedded surfaces without taking stale
    xcframework or build-system changes from the old iOS branch.
  - Keeps manual surface writes inline so iOS typing does not wait on the termio thread wakeup path.
  - Comments each fork-only API/runtime hook with its upstream-removal condition.
  - Checked upstream `ghostty-org/ghostty` `4dcb09ada` on May 1, 2026. It does not expose
    equivalent libghostty surface IO selection, write callback, text-input callback,
    render-now C API, or output C API. Upstream already has internal
    `Termio.processOutput`, so prefer an upstream C bridge if one lands.

### 11) Metal renderer preedit row rebuild guard

- Commits:
  - `70b95dada` (Expose unsafe preedit catch-up in renderer rows)
  - `fe972c095` (Bound renderer preedit catch-up to shaped glyphs)
- Files:
  - `src/renderer/generic.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a regression test for the row-rebuild path where IME/preedit covers the
    only shaped glyph in a row and the remaining terminal cells are empty.
  - Bounds the shaped glyph cursor before reading from the shaped-cell slice, so
    `GenericRenderer(Metal).rebuildRow` no longer assumes terminal cells and
    shaped glyph cells have one-to-one cardinality.
  - The first commit intentionally preserves the panic so cmux can keep the
    required failing-test-then-fix history for https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/3369.

### 12) URL/path regex bounds for spaced file paths

- Commits:
  - `6e10706a7` (test: cover spaced file path link bounds)
  - `6eed7af92` (fix: bound spaced file path links)
  - `ff6e1260d` (fix: handle dotted spaced path prefixes)
- Files:
  - `src/config/url.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds coverage for a path with spaces ending in `.mp4` followed by a normal sentence.
  - Routes dotted paths with spaced directory names through the stricter dotted-path branch.
  - Keeps single-space path components such as `Recovered Screen Recordings` while preserving
    the existing double-space stop case.
  - Trims trailing sentence punctuation when more text follows, without breaking dotted paths
    that end at end-of-line.
  - Preserves versioned or dotted path components before the first space, such as
    `/tmp/v1.2 captures/video.mp4`.

### 13) Cmd-click opens links under mouse reporting (alt-screen TUIs)

- Commits (manaflow-ai/ghostty#71, by @doronpr):
  - `1c7613c95` (fix: open terminal links on cmd-click even when mouse reporting is active)
  - `55d154a97` (fix: gate link refresh on effective mouse-reporting state)
- Follow-up commits (manaflow-ai/ghostty#74):
  - `354e3626b` (fix: suppress mouse reporting for the full cmd-clicked link click)
  - `d1dbbec9b` (fix: key cmd-click link suppression on the modifier, not over_link)
- Follow-up commit (manaflow-ai/ghostty#75):
  - `76ead3eae` (fix: also suppress motion reports during a cmd-clicked link drag)
- Follow-up commit (manaflow-ai/ghostty#76):
  - `f24195271` (fix: scope cmd-click link suppression to left button; clear stale hover)
- Follow-up commits (manaflow-ai/ghostty#77):
  - `5998abddd` (fix: latch cmd-click link suppression for the click lifecycle)
  - `59fb750c0` (fix: clear link-click latch unconditionally on left release)
- Follow-up commit (manaflow-ai/ghostty#78):
  - `9f014e98b` (fix: open latched link on release with press-time chord; defer-clear latch)
- Follow-up commit (manaflow-ai/ghostty#79):
  - `df789cd4b` (fix: only open a latched link click that started on a link)
- Files:
  - `src/Surface.zig`
- Summary:
  - Link hover/highlight state was refreshed in `keyCallback`/`cursorPosCallback`
    only when mouse reporting was off, or shift was releasing the mouse from
    capture. Holding the ctrl/super link-activation modifier was not considered,
    so under a mouse-grabbing alt-screen TUI (Claude Code, Codex) `over_link`
    stayed `false`, the link-click branch in `mouseButtonCallback` was skipped,
    and the Cmd-click was reported to the program — which made cmux fall back to
    the OS default browser instead of honoring the configured link-open target.
  - Adds a shared `mouseLinkRefreshAllowed` gate (pure logic in
    `mouseLinkRefreshAllowedState`) that also allows local link handling when the
    ctrl/super modifier is held, using the effective mouse-reporting state
    (`isMouseReporting()`), matching iTerm2 and macOS Terminal. Fixes
    https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5128.
  - Follow-up (#74): `mouseButtonCallback` ran the link-open path only on
    release, while the mouse-report path ran for both press and release and only
    broke out for the shift-release case — so a Cmd-click over a link still
    reported the *press* to the program and leaked a half-click to mouse-grabbing
    TUIs. The follow-up breaks out of the report path whenever the ctrl/super
    link chord is held (keyed on the modifier, like the shift-release path, so
    cursor jitter can't leak a press or a release), suppressing the whole click.
  - Follow-up (#75): `cursorPosCallback` still emitted `.motion` reports while a
    button was held during the chord, so a drag during link activation leaked
    button-motion. Mirrors the shift "grab override" for the ctrl/super chord in
    the motion path. Net: the link chord suppresses the whole left click+drag —
    press, release, and motion — consistently.
  - Follow-up (#76): scopes that suppression to the left button (ctrl/super
    right/middle clicks still reach the program, since link activation is
    left-only), and clears a stale link highlight/cursor when the chord is
    released through `cursorPosCallback`'s mods (refresh when `over_link` is set,
    mirroring `keyCallback`'s existing reset branch).
  - Follow-up (#77): latches the suppression decision at left-button press
    (`mouse.link_click_active`) and applies it through the release, instead of
    re-checking the live modifier each event — so releasing ctrl/super before the
    mouse button can't leak the release as a half-click. Ties suppression to the
    click lifecycle (press/drag/release), fully closing the half-click class. The
    latch is cleared unconditionally on left release (independent of
    mouse-reporting state) so it can't go stale.
  - Follow-up (#78): unifies the open and suppression decisions. `linkAtPos`
    uses the latched chord while a click is active and the release attempts
    `processLinks` whenever latched, so releasing the modifier before the button
    still opens the link (instead of swallowing the click); the latch is cleared
    via a function-level `defer` so the early-return link-open path resets it.
  - Follow-up (#79): only opens the latched click when it started on a link
    (`link_press_over_link`), so a chord drag that began off a link and released
    over one is swallowed rather than opening a link the press never targeted.
  - Known limitation (noted by review): the bypass matches the default
    `ctrlOrSuper` chord, which is exactly what both link kinds already require to
    activate (OSC 8 `linkAtPos` and the default url `hover_mods = ctrlOrSuper`); a
    user who reconfigures `link.highlight.hover_mods` to a non-default chord would
    not get the under-mouse-reporting bypass. Out of scope for #5128.

### 14) Embedded surface registry serialization

- Commits:
  - `c9b61a8af` (Add surface registry mutation serialization test)
  - `e5c962a72` (Serialize Ghostty surface registry mutations)
- Files:
  - `src/App.zig`
- Summary:
  - Adds a deterministic regression test for concurrent embedded runtime
    surface registry mutation.
  - Protects the native `App.surfaces` list and `focused_surface` pointer with
    one mutex so an off-main `ghostty_surface_free` cannot overlap the main
    actor `ghostty_surface_new` insertion path.
  - Keeps callbacks such as the quit timer outside the registry mutex to avoid
    re-entrancy through the embedder.
- Conflict notes:
  - Any upstream change to `App.addSurface`, `App.deleteSurface`,
    `App.focusedSurface`, or the embedded surface close path should preserve
    serialization of registry/focus mutation across create and free.

The current cmux pin is the merged head `34cbf180d`, which merges the surface
registry serialization (`e5c962a72`, section 14, landed on cmux `main` via
branch `issue-5458-surface-registry-lock`) into the Cmd-click link fix line
(`df789cd4b`, section 13) on top of the iOS render bounded-acquire pin
(`f78189ac1`). It is reachable from `manaflow-ai/ghostty` through branch
`issue-5128-alt-screen-link-open`. Published
`xcframework-34cbf180d8917b802d61d9929cfb493594f2ab52-crashsubdir-cmux-crash-v1`
and pinned its archive checksum in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`. The
release and checksum pin must be regenerated whenever this commit changes, even
for comment-only amends, because the release tag is keyed by the Ghostty commit
SHA.

## Upstreamed fork changes

### cursor-click-to-move respects OSC 133 click-to-move

- Was local in the fork as `10a585754`.
- Landed upstream as `bb646926f`, so it is no longer carried as a fork-only patch.

### zsh prompt redraw follow-ups

- Were local in the fork as `8ade43ce5`, `0cf559581`, `312c7b23a`, and `404a3f175`.
- Dropped during the March 30, 2026 rebase because newer Ghostty prompt-marking changes on the refreshed base superseded these fork-only zsh redraw patches, so cmux no longer carries them separately.

### initial focus seeding and DECSET 1004 startup behavior

- Was local in the fork as `c19c82bfd`.
- Dropped from the current pinned fork head when cmux removed the corresponding
  app-side initial focus seed and went back to post-create focus sync.

## Merge conflict notes

These files change frequently upstream; be careful when rebasing the fork:

- April 28, 2026, upstream merge:
  - Merged upstream `659019666` into `465a9a621` without textual conflicts.
  - Verified with `CMUX_GHOSTTYKIT_NO_PREBUILT=1 ./scripts/ensure-ghosttykit.sh`.
  - Verified cmux with `./scripts/reload.sh --tag gtyup`.
  - Published `xcframework-d3117e03ea19665bc83a28f7e0428c63937e6140` and pinned
    its archive checksum in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.
  - Merged `d3117e03e` into fork `main` with https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/48.
  - Package GhosttyKit archives with `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1`; the archive validator rejects
    macOS AppleDouble entries such as `._GhosttyKit.xcframework`.

- April 28, 2026, theme picker restore:
  - Reapplied the section 4 cmux picker hooks on top of `d3117e03e`.
  - Enter in cmux mode must call the same selection-apply path used by keyboard/mouse navigation
    before setting the picker outcome to apply.
  - Verified with `zig build cli-helper -Dapp-runtime=none -Demit-macos-app=false -Demit-xcframework=false -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`.
  - Verified Enter writes `theme = light:0x96f,dark:0x96f` in a PTY temp-config run.
  - Published `xcframework-04ec69173f8f5ac5a2568afca0faf8e4a74b2dc2` and pinned
    its archive checksum in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

- April 30, 2026, theme picker search Enter:
  - Search-mode Enter in cmux mode must apply the current filtered selection and exit with
    outcome `apply`.
  - Escape still leaves search mode, and stock Ghostty search Enter still returns to normal mode.
  - Verified with `./scripts/reload.sh --tag thmenter`.
  - Published `xcframework-4265d34282ce2023c27da851c454dabe6cdc76ce` and pinned
    its archive checksum in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.

- May 1, 2026, manual embedded IO for libghostty iOS:
  - Added only the manual embedded IO API/runtime pieces on top of fork `main` `495316732`.
  - Avoided old iOS branch `.gitignore`, package, and xcframework build-system changes.
  - Checked upstream `ghostty-org/ghostty` `4dcb09ada`; no equivalent public libghostty
    surface IO API exists yet.
  - Added comments to the fork-only hunks stating that they should be deleted in favor of
    an upstream implementation when one exists.
  - Verified with `zig build test`.
  - Verified the universal macOS plus iOS xcframework path with
    `CMUX_GHOSTTYKIT_NO_PREBUILT=1 ./scripts/ensure-ghosttykit.sh`.
  - Published `xcframework-22fa801f88f96fa842e54ecce6c34a5d36003d19` and pinned
    its archive checksum in `scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`.
  - Merged https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty/pull/53 so the submodule SHA is
    reachable from fork `main`.

- `src/terminal/osc.zig`
  - OSC dispatch logic moves often. Re-check the integration points for the OSC 99 parser and keep
    the newer `capture`/`captureTrailing()` API usage intact.

- `src/terminal/osc/parsers.zig`
  - Ensure `kitty_notification` stays imported after upstream parser reorganizations.

- `src/cli/list_themes.zig`
  - cmux now relies on the upstream picker UI plus local env-driven hooks for live preview and restore.
    If upstream reorganizes the preview loop or key handling, re-check the cmux mode path and keep the
    stock Ghostty behavior unchanged when the cmux env vars are absent.
  - The April 28, 2026 restore requires Enter in cmux mode to call the same selection-apply path
    used by keyboard/mouse navigation before setting the picker outcome to apply.
  - The April 30, 2026 follow-up requires the same behavior from search mode, while preserving Escape
    as the search cancel path.

- `build.zig`
  - Upstream's new wasm/libghostty work touched the same build graph. Keep the cmux-only `cli-helper`
    step wired in without regressing the upstream `lib-vt` or wasm build paths.

- `src/main_ghostty.zig`
  - The April 28, 2026 restore only conflicted on stdout writer API usage. Keep the current
    `std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&buf)` API plus explicit flush.

- `include/ghostty.h`, `src/Surface.zig`, `src/apprt/embedded.zig`
  - Upstream removed cmux-used selection exports. Preserve the re-exported
    `ghostty_surface_select_cursor_cell` and `ghostty_surface_clear_selection` functions.

- `src/renderer/generic.zig`
  - The `macos-background-from-layer` check sits next to the glass-style check in `updateFrame`.
    If upstream refactors the bg_color uniform update or the glass conditional, re-check that both
    paths still zero out `bg_color[3]` correctly.

- `src/Surface.zig`, `src/apprt/embedded.zig`, `macos/Sources/Ghostty/Surface View/SurfaceView.swift`
  - The initial `focused` plumbing has to stay aligned across the C config, embedded runtime surface,
    and macOS wrapper. If upstream refactors surface creation or post-create focus sync, re-check that
    background panes can start unfocused without synthesizing a focus-loss transition during creation.

- `src/Surface.zig` (modifier tracking)
  - `modsChanged` and the key callback's link-highlight gate must compare binding mods against
    binding mods (stored mouse mods are binding-only). cmux sends sided modifier bits on key
    events for `macos-option-as-alt = left|right`; comparing raw mods re-dirties the screen and
    re-runs the link refresh on every event while a sided or lock modifier is held. If upstream
    refactors modifier tracking, keep the binding-normalized comparison.

- `src/termio/stream_handler.zig`
  - Keep DECSET 1004 enablement side-effect free. xterm-compatible focus reporting should only emit
    `CSI I` / `CSI O` on actual focus transitions, not immediately when the mode is enabled.

- `src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig`
  - Keep the APC handler wired into `.apc_start`, `.apc_put`, `.apc_end`, and preserve the
    `apcEnd()` response path so kitty graphics still reach `Terminal.kittyGraphics()` and reply via
    `write_pty`.

If you resolve a conflict, update this doc with what changed.
