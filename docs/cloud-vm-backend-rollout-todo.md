> **Provider update (2026-09-16):** This rollout checklist is historical. cmux Cloud now uses PlanetScale PostgreSQL (`cmux` / `cmux-prod`, `main` production, `staging` staging, `development` development). Do not execute the old AWS Aurora/RDS steps below. Use `skills/cmux-backend/references/cloud-vm-control-plane.md` and the current `cloud-vm-migrate.yml` workflow.

# Cloud VM Backend Rollout Todo

This is the scoped todo list for making the Cloud VM backend production-ready with application logic running in the existing Vercel `manaflow/cmux` project.

> **2026-09-02:** Freestyle on the public platform (`api.freestyle.sh`) is the
> only active Cloud VM provider. E2B, Blaxel, Daytona, the old `cmuxd-remote`
> gateway, and Rivet actors are historical migration records. They are not
> valid values for current deployment or dogfood commands.

> **2026-09-04 current-main re-audit:** The terminal placement rename and
> canonical remote-state synchronization remain absent from `main`; current
> `main` adds no replacement for them. The branch is rebased on
> `e83b83229fc08a313fa958b36cb7926f14538108` (the current `main` browser
> revert, [PR 11966](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/11966)). Freestyle is still the only
> active provider. The direct development backend is healthy, but the shared
> free account has `maxActiveVms=0`, so an authenticated live VM rename smoke
> remains pending a paid or explicitly provisioned test VM.

## Current State

- Vercel project exists: `manaflow/cmux`.
- Vercel root directory is `web`.
- Production URL is `https://cmux.com`.
- Vercel custom `staging` environment exists for the `manaflow/cmux` project and tracks the
  `staging` git branch.
- VM application logic already runs in the Vercel Next app:
  - `web/app/api/vm/**`
  - `web/services/vms/**`
- Current durable VM control-plane state is in Postgres:
  - `cloud_vms`
  - `cloud_vm_leases`
  - `cloud_vm_tunnel_enrollment_locks`
  - `cloud_vm_usage_events`
- WebSocket PTY and browser proxy data paths use the authenticated `cmux-remote`
  link after the REST handshake.
- No separate AWS app server is required for the current version.
- A separate `manaflow/cmux-staging` Vercel project exists for staging.

The checked-in image manifest is the source of truth for active and rollback
images. Its active validated Freestyle ladder is
`freestyle-cmux-devbox-20260903b-{sm,md,lg,xl,2xl}` for both desktop and base
kinds. The resolver selects the smallest entry that meets the requested memory.
Older validated entries are rollback images, and the retired beta snapshot
remains only for provenance. `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` is a legacy name
retained for audit and image-build metadata; runtime image selection does not
read it.

## State and rename synchronization contract

The cmux-tui daemon owns the canonical remote graph: machines contain
workspaces, workspaces contain tab views, and tab views point to terminals,
browsers, and agents. The macOS app must not create a second remote graph.

- `CloudMachineLink` owns one authenticated subscription per VM, its cursor,
  reconnect policy, and bounded recovery.
- `CloudVMState` is one immutable graph with an explicit synchronization mode.
  `journaled` state has a `(generation, revision)` cursor. A legacy
  `snapshot_only` state has a null cursor but keeps the complete graph for
  inspection and agent export. `SurfaceCatalog` installs that graph and its
  derived rows in one main-actor transaction, so UI, CLI, and restored
  projections read the same version.
- Full snapshots are authoritative. A delta is accepted only when it is
  contiguous and complete. Unknown or malformed events are barriers, trigger a
  coalesced snapshot repair, and stop after five barriers with an explicit
  warning. Recovery never loops without a bound.
- An authoritative snapshot must include every modeled graph collection, even
  when empty: `workspaces`, `screens`, `panes`, `tabs`, `terminals`, `browsers`,
  and `agents`. A missing or wrongly typed collection is a recovery barrier,
  never an empty graph. Unknown top-level collections remain optional and stay
  in the canonical document.
- Event-feed recovery has one phase model, not independent retry flags. A
  reconnect keeps its consecutive-failure count until an accepted journaled
  stream remains healthy for ten seconds or a new authenticated connection is
  made. The first exhausted run gets one snapshot-recovery restart without
  erasing the spent budget. Ordinary later refreshes cannot reset an exhausted
  feed.
- IDs are identity and names are labels. Resolve an exact ID first. Resolve a
  name only when it is unique. Ambiguous or stale placement fails closed.
- A tab rename changes one exact tab placement. A terminal rename is an
  explicit compatibility operation that changes every placement of that
  terminal. For both operations, a non-empty name sets a custom label and
  `""` clears it so the daemon can regenerate its title. A missing name is
  not a clear request. Workspace rename uses revision compare-and-set and
  retains its non-empty-name invariant.
- Remote events reconcile every local projection that stores the exact remote
  workspace and tab IDs. Local write-through uses the same mutation path and
  never echoes a daemon-originated update back to the daemon.
- Projection lifecycle reconciliation fills a missing local workspace binding
  after record, restore, or move only when all identity-bearing cloud panes
  agree on one `(machine, remote_workspace_id)` and no local pane is present.
  Identity-less cloud displays, ports, and pool terminals are neutral; mixed or
  ambiguous workspaces stay unbound. Explicit `workspace.cloud_vm_bind` values
  remain authoritative across disconnects.
- Rename intents are serialized by one process-wide, machine-scoped mutation
  lane. The intent map still keys optimistic names by `(machine, scope,
  remote_id)`, but the lane covers workspace, exact-tab, and terminal fan-out
  writes together because the daemon cursor is global to the VM. Tree, socket,
  CLI, and local projection paths enter through `SurfaceCatalog`; provider
  methods are transport primitives. A local binding or projection stores the
  exact remote ID; legacy fallback is allowed only for one unambiguous view.
- Local lookup and projection reconciliation use the constructable
  `CloudWorkspaceRenameService`, injected by the app composition root. Its
  environment contains only workspace and tab-manager lookup closures, so tests
  can isolate it without `AppDelegate.shared`. The catalog still owns the
  mutation lane and accepted graph. This is a deliberate seam for future
  multi-window and agent control surfaces, not a second remote-state cache.
- Delta publication uses one canonical `CloudVMState.document` plus a
  materialized typed-graph index. The document stores every top-level value and
  collection row as canonical JSON fragments, so a title, lifecycle, agent, or
  same-placement tab change replaces one fragment and updates only the affected
  typed rows. Each collection also maintains a derived identity index for `id`
  and legacy agent `terminal_id`, so row resolution is O(1) after the O(rows)
  snapshot build. Any relationship-root, creation, deletion, move, or content
  change rebuilds the complete derived resource set. The indexes are
  non-persisted caches, and `rawSnapshot` is materialized only at export or
  recovery boundaries. A targeted row and a full snapshot therefore use the
  same authoritative document.
- Mutation responses are receipts, not a second graph. A journaled response
  carries `(generation, revision)` and terminal creation carries the exact
  `CreatedTerminalPath`. The provider exposes the receipt as transient
  `pending_writes` until an accepted graph reaches the same cursor, then removes
  it. A known older generation or a graph before the receipt is rejected. A
  graph at the exact receipt cursor must contain the requested workspace or tab
  name. This gives immediate rename commands an exact target without letting a
  delayed or contradictory snapshot erase a successful write.
- Canonical collection order preserves snapshot and export order only. Layout
  order comes from row `index` values and relationship IDs. Agents and UI code
  must not infer identity or placement from JSON array position when an index
  is present. The compatibility parser may retain daemon order for legacy
  one-shot rows without an index; authoritative state still requires complete
  graph collections.
- The daemon name is canonical for a projected cloud workspace or tab. A local
  rename is an optimistic intent until the receipt fence accepts the daemon
  graph. A later remote observation replaces the local value without another
  write. A local-only alias needs a separate field and is outside this contract.
- A resource kind that is absent from the client's known delta storage map is a
  fail-closed barrier. The app fetches one bounded full snapshot instead of
  guessing a plural key or identity rule. The snapshot retains the new kind as
  opaque state, so protocol growth is visible to agents without risking a
  misapplied mutation.
- Freshness is explicit: an accepted graph is `current` or `stale`; absence of
  a graph is represented by no `cloud_state` entry, not a third fake freshness
  value. A cached graph may be displayed as stale, but it may not authorize a
  new placement or rename.
- Snapshot-only compatibility is explicit. The app suspends the event reader for
  an unversioned Freestyle daemon, keeps all rows visible, and rejects workspace
  and tab rename writes until the daemon is upgraded. A malformed non-null
  cursor is rejected rather than treated as legacy.
- Freestyle route selection reads the canonical `vpcs` addresses when that
  field is present, uses the deprecated `networks` alias only when `vpcs` is
  absent, prefers private IPv4, then private IPv6, and uses public IPv6 only for
  a machine with no private address list. Private machines require the owner's
  WireGuard tunnel. `cmux-remote` Noise enrollment remains the only managed
  session transport. Freestyle's scoped SSH proxy is provider-level access and
  is not a managed fallback.
- Freestyle model-plane readiness is checked with the VM-bound
  `/api/coderouter/vm-usage/self` route after boot. The probe validates edge
  token injection without selecting a model or spending upstream credits; a
  failed probe rolls the provider machine back.

Agent-facing controls are JSON-first and composable: `cmux vm tree --json`,
`surface.catalog`, `surface.project`, `vm tab rename`, and the explicit
`vm terminal rename` compatibility command. The full graph costs more parsing at
snapshot boundaries than a row-only cache, but the canonical fragment document
prevents divergent identity maps and avoids re-encoding unrelated rows during
steady-state deltas. Derived rows keep UI updates small. Bounded recovery caps
provider and CPU use, with an operator-visible warning when the event stream
remains incompatible.

## Current Blockers

- [x] Create AWS IAM migration roles trusted by GitHub OIDC for the two Cloud VM environments.
- [x] Add GitHub Environment secret `AWS_MIGRATION_ROLE_ARN` to both `cloud-vm-staging` and `cloud-vm-production`.
- [x] Copy minimal DB migration variables from Vercel into both GitHub Cloud VM environments:
  - `PGHOST`
  - `PGPORT`
  - `PGUSER`
  - `PGDATABASE`
  - `CMUX_DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`
- [x] Copy Stack smoke variables from Vercel into both GitHub Cloud VM environments:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
  - `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`
- [x] Add Axiom/OpenTelemetry env to both Vercel projects:
  - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
- [x] Publish and validate the current Freestyle snapshot with the cmux-tui daemon.
- [x] Promote the validated public snapshot configuration to the active provider
  manifest and local dogfood environment.
- [x] Verify Freestyle create/attach, `cmux-remote` transport, and provider tunnel
  recovery against a live sandbox.
- [ ] Verify the tagged macOS client can reach a private Freestyle VM and observe
  daemon state plus tab/workspace rename persistence end to end. The API and
  daemon checks pass, but this Mac's existing WireGuard route currently reports
  `utun8` without a working provider handshake.
- [x] Verify local-to-cloud workspace and exact tab rename write-through from the
  catalog projection lifecycle, including restore and existing-target opens.
- [x] Preserve complete state from legacy Freestyle snapshots without a cursor;
  expose `snapshot_only` to agents and fail revision-fenced writes clearly.
- [x] Keep one canonical fragment document for known and unknown daemon state;
  derive typed rows and indexes from it, and apply row-local deltas without
  full-document re-encoding.
- [x] Verify reverse tab-content edges, legacy terminal tab references, tab
  moves, and large opaque collections in focused behavior tests.
- [x] Serialize Freestyle tunnel enrollment, read-with-attachment-heal, revoke,
  and account cleanup per `(user_id, device_fingerprint)` with a durable
  owner-token lease, renewal, expiry recovery, and fail-closed migration guard.
- [ ] Apply `cloud_vm_tunnel_enrollment_locks` in staging and production before
  deploying the route, then rehearse an expired lease and a concurrent request.
- [ ] Persist the claimed cmux-tui device fingerprint/device id in each lease and
  revoke only those device records on sign-out. Freestyle currently revokes the
  control-plane lease rows, but not daemon enrollment records.
- [x] Make missing Freestyle VPC member-rule repair fail closed. A rejected
  listing or repair now fails network ensure instead of creating a private VM
  that the owner's tunnel cannot reach.
- [x] Keep existing tunnel reads and revokes usable during a private-network
  rollback. The disabled flag blocks new VPC provisioning, but an existing
  provider network is read by id and is never recreated as a side effect.
- [ ] Run authenticated preview and staging create/attach/browser-proxy smoke
  after the next deployment.
- [ ] Decide whether provider create needs an asynchronous status flow after
  measuring the Vercel function duration on a real Freestyle create.
- [ ] Rotate the Freestyle key and complete the secret-leak audit before a broad
  production rollout.

## Current Operational State

- [x] GitHub environments `cloud-vm-staging` and `cloud-vm-production` exist.
- [x] GitHub environment variable `AWS_REGION=us-west-2` is set for both Cloud VM environments.
- [x] GitHub OIDC provider `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` exists in AWS.
- [x] Staging migration role is scoped to `repo:manaflow-ai/cmux:environment:cloud-vm-staging` and the staging Aurora cluster resource id.
- [x] Production migration role is scoped to `repo:manaflow-ai/cmux:environment:cloud-vm-production` and the production Aurora cluster resource id.
- [x] Staging and production Cloud VM default provider are set to Freestyle.
- [x] Freestyle creates are enabled in the verified deployment configuration.
- [x] Both Vercel projects contain the Freestyle API key as a Sensitive
  variable. The env audit verifies key presence through Vercel metadata because
  the pinned CLI redacts the value.
- [x] Freestyle create, `cmux-remote` attach, and provider tunnel state-recovery
  smoke passed without creating a production VM during the audit.
- [ ] Tagged macOS end-to-end rename smoke is pending a working private-network
  route; focused client and backend behavior tests pass.
- [x] Production auth/list smoke passed without creating a production VM.
- [x] Axiom/OpenTelemetry env is set and redeployed in staging and production.
- [x] GitHub Cloud VM smoke workflows no longer require `VERCEL_TOKEN`.
- [ ] Configure `CMUX_ALERTS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in staging, or record the named
  operator decision in `CMUX_ALERTS_SINK_UNCONFIGURED_ACK`. Production has the
  acknowledgement and passes the audit; staging has neither and remains red.
- [ ] Remove retired subrouter and coderouter access-gate variables from the
  staging Vercel project. Runtime code ignores them, but the env audit reports
  the stale configuration.

## Existing Vercel Env Vars

These are already configured in Vercel for development, preview, and production:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `CMUX_FEEDBACK_FROM_EMAIL`
- `CMUX_FEEDBACK_RATE_LIMIT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`

## Phase 1: Finish Current Vercel Backend Setup

- [x] Use a dedicated Vercel staging project instead of sharing preview secrets.
- [x] Add a global VM create kill switch, `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED`.
- [x] Add the Freestyle provider kill switch, `CMUX_VM_FREESTYLE_ENABLED`.
- [x] Set the global and Freestyle create switches to enabled values in the
  verified deployment configuration.
- [ ] Add a preview allowlist before paid provider calls if preview uses real provider keys:
  - Stack user ids
  - Stack org ids later, if org billing exists
- [x] Set `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=freestyle` in the verified local and deployed
  environments.
- [x] Set the Freestyle credential in the verified provider environments.
  `FREESTYLE_API_KEY` is normal; a complete `FREESTYLE_STACK_ACCESS_TOKEN` plus
  `FREESTYLE_TEAM_ID` pair is also valid. Audit tools verify Sensitive key
  presence through Vercel metadata and never print values. An authenticated
  create smoke must still prove validity. The checked-in manifest selects the
  image.
- [x] Set Axiom/OpenTelemetry env in the verified staging and production
  environments:
  - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
  - `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
- [ ] Confirm Vercel function max duration for VM routes. `POST /api/vm` can wait on real provider
  provisioning, so the route either needs a sufficient `maxDuration` or must become an async
  create-status flow before production.
- [ ] Confirm Stack Auth callback and trusted domains include:
  - `https://cmux.com`
  - the Vercel preview domain pattern used by this project
  - local `CMUX_PORT` development callback URLs
- [ ] Redeploy Vercel preview after the rename branch merges.
- [ ] Smoke test the deployed preview:
  - `cmux auth login`
  - `cmux vm new --provider freestyle`
  - `cmux vm attach <id>`
  - browser proxy against a simple HTTP server inside the VM
- [ ] Redeploy production only after preview and staging smoke tests pass.

## Phase 2: Local Secret Parity

- [ ] Keep local Stack/web runtime secrets in `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env`.
- [ ] Keep production Stack/web runtime secrets in `~/.secrets/cmuxterm.env`.
- [ ] Keep provider image-build secrets in `~/.secrets/cmux.env`.
- [ ] Add runtime VM vars to the relevant `~/.secrets/cmuxterm*.env` file:
  - `CMUX_VM_DEFAULT_PROVIDER`
  - `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED`
  - `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING` (leave unset; the paid-plan gate is the safe default and
    `audit-vercel-env.mjs` fails when a shared environment sets it to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`/`enabled`)
  - `CMUX_VM_REQUIRE_PRO` (legacy compatibility alias only: `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`/`disabled`
    enables free provisioning **only while** `CMUX_VM_ALLOW_FREE_PROVISIONING` is unset; any set
    value of the new switch wins, and every other legacy value or unset keeps the gate on)
  - `CMUX_VM_FREESTYLE_ENABLED`
  - `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` only when running an image-build or legacy
    audit command; it is ignored by VM runtime resolution
  - Axiom/OpenTelemetry vars
- [x] Document the split between `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env`, `~/.secrets/cmuxterm.env`, and
  `~/.secrets/cmux.env` in `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Replace `web/.env.local` local development with the committed `web/.envrc` and `bun dev`
  loader.
- [ ] Make the script print missing keys by name only, never values.

## Phase 3: Image Manifest and Rollback

Keep every Freestyle snapshot ID in the checked-in image manifest. The entry
flagged `defaultForKind` is the active image, and rollback is a manifest change
followed by a deploy. Runtime image resolution never uses an environment image
selector, so an old `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` value cannot silently override
the reviewed image.

- [x] Add a checked-in image manifest, `web/services/vms/images/manifest.json`.
- [x] Stop relying on hardcoded or environment-selected image ids in deployed
  environments. Production and preview fail closed when the manifest has no
  validated `defaultForKind` entry.
- [x] Record every known-good Freestyle snapshot with:
  - image version
  - Freestyle snapshot id
  - cmux-tui daemon artifact provenance
  - build timestamp
  - builder script version
  - validation status
  - notes for known limitations
- [x] Add docs for the manifest default and mark
  `FREESTYLE_SANDBOX_SNAPSHOT` as a legacy ignored selector.
- [x] Add docs for rollback:
  - choose a previous known-good manifest entry
  - mark it `defaultForKind`
  - open and merge the manifest PR
  - redeploy
  - confirm new VMs use the old image
- [x] Ensure VM create responses or internal telemetry record:
  - provider
  - selected image id
  - manifest image version when available
- [x] Validate active Vercel image env vars against the manifest during VM create.
- [x] Add tests for deployed image resolution:
  - missing image env fails before provider call
  - unknown image id fails before provider call
  - known manifest image resolves to the expected provider id
- [ ] Keep old Freestyle snapshots until all active VMs using them are gone.

## Phase 4: Image Build and Promotion Workflow

- [x] Make image build script output a manifest entry instead of relying on chat notes.
- [x] Build the Freestyle snapshot from the pinned cmux-tui daemon artifact.
- [x] Record artifact provenance:
  - cmux-tui release/artifact manifest entry
  - cmux-tui install and bootstrap command
  - binary SHA256
  - artifact URL used by Freestyle snapshot creation
- [ ] Run Freestyle smoke tests after image build:
  - shell starts
  - `cmux-remote` Noise session authenticates over `/v1/link`
  - terminal RPC and command execution work
  - browser proxy can reach an HTTP server inside the VM
  - locale/sudo/python sanity checks pass
- [ ] Add the validated manifest entry in the same PR as any snapshot ID update.
- [ ] Promote the snapshot in this order:
  - preview/staging env vars
  - preview smoke tests
  - production env vars
  - production redeploy
  - production smoke tests
- [ ] Do not delete old Freestyle snapshots during the same promotion.

## Phase 5: VM Create Rate Limits

- [x] Add per-team active VM limits before paid provider create calls.
- [x] Limit `POST /api/vm` more strictly than other VM endpoints through active VM limits.
- [x] Keep `GET /api/vm`, attach, and status endpoints generous.
- [x] Include idempotency keys in create handling so retries do not double count active VM creates.
- [x] Decide first implementation: Postgres active VM limits, no Redis/Upstash dependency yet.
- [x] Add tests for:
  - unauthenticated create blocked before provider call
  - over-limit create blocked before provider call
  - retry with same idempotency key does not create a duplicate provider VM
- [x] Add a provider-budget circuit breaker so a provider outage or runaway loop can disable new
  creates while leaving attach/delete available.

## Phase 5.5: Security Hardening Before Production

- [x] Add CSRF/origin protection for cookie-authenticated mutating VM routes. Native bearer-token
  calls are not CSRFable, but browser cookie fallback for `POST`/`DELETE` should check `Origin` or
  `Sec-Fetch-Site`.
- [x] Add ownership tests for every mutating per-VM endpoint:
  - another user cannot `DELETE /api/vm/:id`
  - another user cannot `POST /api/vm/:id/exec`
  - another user cannot mint attach or SSH endpoints
- [x] Remove raw `/api/rivet/*`; there is no raw actor action surface to test.
- [ ] Add a provider API key rotation runbook for Freestyle.
- [ ] Audit logs, spans, JSON responses, and terminal startup commands for secret leakage:
  - provider API keys
  - Stack access/refresh tokens
  - attach PTY tokens
  - attach RPC tokens
  - Freestyle SSH passwords/identity handles
- [ ] Harden the browser proxy contract:
  - leases are scoped to one VM and one session
  - proxy cannot become an arbitrary public open proxy
  - target host/port policy is explicit and tested
- [ ] Add a production emergency cleanup procedure:
  - list VMs by user
  - destroy by provider VM id
  - revoke attach/SSH credentials
  - disable new creates globally or per provider

## Phase 6: Usage Ledger

This should be a follow-up after the current VM PR unless billing becomes a launch blocker.

- [ ] Add durable usage storage.
- [ ] Record VM lifecycle events:
  - user id
  - provider
  - provider VM id
  - image id
  - manifest image version
  - created timestamp
  - destroyed timestamp
  - failure reason when provisioning fails
- [ ] Record attach events:
  - PTY lease minted
  - RPC lease minted or reused
  - transport
  - provider
- [ ] Record exec events:
  - command count
  - timeout
  - exit code
  - duration
- [ ] Do not store raw command text, PTY output, browser traffic, or attach tokens in the usage
  ledger unless a separate privacy review explicitly approves it.
- [ ] Add cost rollups by user, provider, and day.
- [ ] Make cleanup jobs idempotent so orphan cleanup cannot double count usage.
- [ ] Add provider spend alerts independent of app telemetry:
  - Freestyle dashboard/API budget alert
  - Vercel spend alert for function usage

## Phase 7: Database Control Plane and Legacy Removal

Postgres is the durable control plane for Cloud VMs. The current VM API has no
Rivet dependency. PTY and browser traffic uses the authenticated `cmux-remote`
link after the Vercel REST handshake. The remaining work is cleanup and
operational proof, not a provider migration.

- [x] Add Postgres as the durable control plane foundation for Cloud VMs.
- [x] Use Drizzle for TypeScript schema and migrations.
- [x] Add CMUX_PORT-derived local Postgres so parallel worktrees do not collide.
- [x] Add CI migration verification against a real Postgres service.
- [x] Add the first internal DB-backed VM read model and real Postgres test.
- [x] Add a Vercel Marketplace Aurora OIDC/RDS IAM runtime DB adapter.
- [x] Add a dedicated `bun db:migrate:aws-rds-iam` migration command for production/staging.
- [x] Seed Vercel staging and production with app/provider DB driver env names.
- [ ] Connect the Vercel Marketplace Aurora resource to `manaflow/cmux` for both `staging` and production so these env names are present:
  - `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
  - `AWS_REGION`
  - `PGHOST`
  - `PGPORT`
  - `PGUSER`
  - `PGDATABASE`
- [ ] Keep app runtime DB user separate from migration DB user.
- [ ] Run migrations through protected GitHub Actions, never during Vercel build/startup.
- [x] Replace `userVmsActor` and `vmActor` with Vercel route handlers plus database tables:
  - users
  - VMs
  - leases
  - idempotency keys
  - usage events
- [x] Replace `userVmsActor.list` with `SELECT ... FROM vms WHERE user_id = ...`.
- [x] Replace `userVmsActor.create` with a Vercel route handler using:
  - `Idempotency-Key`
  - a unique DB constraint on `(user_id, idempotency_key)`
  - `status = provisioning | running | failed | destroyed`
  - a provider VM id recorded once available
- [x] Do not use an actor for create retries. Vercel can safely retry when the request includes an
  idempotency key and the DB row is the source of truth.
- [x] Define create retry behavior:
  - first request inserts a `provisioning` row
  - duplicate request with same idempotency key returns the existing row
  - if provider create finished, return the provider VM id
  - if create is still in progress, return `409`
  - if create failed, return the recorded failure and allow an explicit new idempotency key
- [ ] Decide whether provider create stays synchronous or becomes async:
  - synchronous is simpler but depends on Vercel function duration
  - async requires a queue or background worker but avoids long HTTP requests
- [ ] Add `GET /api/vm/:id/status` or equivalent before moving long creates fully async.
- [x] Replace actor serialization with DB correctness:
  - unique constraints for idempotency
  - row locks or advisory locks around destroy/attach/snapshot
  - conditional status transitions
  - retry-safe cleanup jobs
- [ ] Add a replacement for actor-owned cleanup:
  - expired lease cleanup
  - orphan provider VM cleanup
  - stuck provisioning cleanup
- [x] No legacy actor migration is needed for new Cloud VM state. If pre-merge
  actor state existed, treat those VMs as pre-production and clean them up
  provider-side.
- [x] Remove Rivet env requirements after the DB-backed routes are live:
  - `RIVET_ENDPOINT`
  - `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`
  - `RIVET_RUNNER_VERSION`
  - `RIVET_TOKEN`
  - `RIVET_NAMESPACE`
  - `CMUX_RIVET_INTERNAL_SECRET`
- [x] Remove `/api/rivet/**` routes after no VM code path depends on Rivet.
- [x] Remove `rivetkit` dependency after the route migration and state migration are complete.

## Phase 8: CI/CD Guardrails

- [ ] PR checks should run web typecheck, Bun tests, and the remote-state contract tests.
- [ ] PR checks should not call paid providers by default.
- [ ] Provider tests should use a `MockVMProvider` by default. Only the explicit
  staging smoke job may call Freestyle.
- [ ] Staging smoke tests may call real Freestyle with tiny quotas.
- [ ] Vercel preview checks should verify the project root is still `web`.
- [ ] Add a CI check that required deployed env var names are documented in `web/.env.example` and
  `web/services/vms/README.md`.
- [ ] Add a safe Vercel env audit command to the runbook that prints names/scopes only, never values.
- [ ] Production promotion should require manual approval.
- [ ] Production promotion should redeploy Vercel after env/image changes.
- [ ] Production promotion should run smoke tests without destructive cleanup of user VMs.

## Phase 9: Observability

- [ ] Confirm Axiom preview dataset receives spans from Vercel preview.
- [ ] Confirm Axiom production dataset receives spans from Vercel production.
- [ ] Add or verify spans for:
  - VM create route
  - provider create
  - control-plane create transaction
  - attach endpoint minting
  - WebSocket attach
  - browser proxy startup
  - provider errors
  - rate-limit blocks
- [ ] Add dashboards or saved queries for:
  - VM create duration for Freestyle
  - provider failure rate
  - attach latency
  - browser proxy failures
  - rate-limit blocks by user
- [ ] Add alerts, not just dashboards:
  - provider create failure spike
  - p95 VM create duration regression
  - attach endpoint failures
  - browser proxy startup failures
  - unexpected increase in active VM count

## Phase 10: Documentation

- [ ] Update `web/services/vms/README.md` with the final Vercel env list.
- [ ] Add image promotion and rollback instructions.
- [ ] Add local env setup instructions.
- [ ] Add production promotion instructions.
- [ ] Add Vercel environment variable audit instructions.
- [ ] Add `CMUX_VM_CREATE_ENABLED` and provider kill-switch docs.
- [x] Add security notes for Stack Auth bearer plus refresh tokens, provider
  attach leases, and `cmux-remote` invitation/device-key handling.
- [ ] Document secret redaction for provider keys, attach tokens, and daemon
  startup commands.
- [ ] Add a license/package-boundary note if future backend-only code is intended to use a different
  license from the rest of the repo.
- [ ] Add a future `cmux-infra` or `backend-rollout` skill so agents follow this
  workflow consistently, including the state/rename contract above.

## Historical migration record

The following systems are retained only for auditability and rollback history:

- E2B, Blaxel, and Daytona provider adapters and image selectors were removed.
- The old `cmuxd-remote` WebSocket gateway and its lease-file protocol were
  replaced by the cmux-tui daemon and `cmux-remote` transport.
- Rivet actor routes and state were replaced by Postgres route handlers.

Do not restore these names to deployment env, provider selection, or new image
build instructions. Historical references in migration files, audit tests, and
the daemon spike document must remain labelled as historical.
