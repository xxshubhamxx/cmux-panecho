# cmux CLI Contract

This document is the compatibility contract for migrating `CLI/cmux.swift` to
Swift ArgumentParser. The migration should preserve command names, aliases,
global flags, exit behavior, socket routing, and no-socket help behavior unless
a PR explicitly calls out an intentional contract change.

The current implementation is a hand-rolled parser. This spec is deliberately
written around user-visible behavior so the implementation can change behind it.

## Migration Rules

- Keep `cmux --help`, `cmux -h`, `cmux --version`, and `cmux -v` working without
  connecting to the cmux socket.
- Keep documented `cmux <command> --help` probes working without a socket where
  they already do.
- Keep `--socket`, `--password`, and `--window` as global options before the
  command. Keep presentation options `--json` and `--id-format` accepted either
  before or after the command.
- Keep UUIDs, refs such as `workspace:2`, and indexes accepted wherever the
  command accepts a window, workspace, pane, surface, or tab handle.
- Keep text output stable for scripting commands unless a command already
  documents JSON as the scripting interface.
- Keep hidden/internal commands available until their callers have migrated.

## Global Invocation

| Form | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `cmux <path>` | Open a directory or file parent in cmux through the app's file-open path, without requiring control-socket access. Relative paths resolve from the current working directory. |
| `cmux [global-options] <command> [options]` | Run a named command. Presentation options may appear before or after the command. |
| `cmux --help`, `cmux -h` | Print top-level usage without a socket. |
| `cmux help` | Print top-level usage without a socket. |
| `cmux --version`, `cmux -v`, `cmux version` | Print version summary without a socket. |

Global options:

| Option | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `--socket <path>` | Override the socket path for this invocation. |
| `--password <value>` | Use an explicit socket password. Takes precedence over `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD`. |
| `--json` | Prefer machine-readable JSON output for commands that support it. |
| `--id-format <refs\|uuids\|both>` | Select handle format in JSON and supported text output. |
| `--window <id\|ref\|index>` | Route the command through a specific window when supported. |

Environment:

| Variable | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` | Canonical socket path override. |
| `CMUX_SOCKET` | Deprecated compatibility alias for `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`. New scripts should use `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`; if both variables are set and differ, the CLI fails before socket commands. |
| `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD` | Socket password fallback when `--password` is absent. |
| `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` | Default workspace context inside cmux terminals. |
| `CMUX_SURFACE_ID` | Default surface context inside cmux terminals. |
| `CMUX_TAB_ID` | Default tab context for tab commands. |

## Top-Level Commands

| `window displays` | List connected displays (name, index, main flag). |
| `window display <name\|index>` | Move the instance's window(s) onto a display by name (exact, substring) or index, preserving size. Does not steal focus. With `--window`, targets that window; otherwise moves all main windows. `--list` aliases `window displays`. |
| `window default-display [<name>\|--clear]` | Set, show (no arg), or clear (`--clear`) the shared, cross-tag default display that DEBUG dev builds open new windows on, stored in `~/.config/cmux/cmux.json` under `app.devWindowDisplay`.

| `reorder-workspace` | Reorder a workspace inside a window. |
| `reorder-workspaces` | Atomically reorder workspaces inside pinned and unpinned groups. |
| `workspace-action` | Run workspace context-menu actions from the CLI. |

| `move-tab-to-new-workspace` | Move a tab or surface into a newly created workspace. |
| `list-workspaces` | List workspaces. |
| `new-workspace` | Create a workspace, optionally with cwd, command, description, layout, and per-workspace environment variables (`--env KEY=VALUE` repeatable, `--env-file <path>`). See [Workspace environment variables](#workspace-environment-variables). |
| `ssh` | Open an SSH-backed workspace. Preserves the caller's live `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` for app-launched OpenSSH processes so `ForwardAgent yes` from ssh_config works normally. Supports `-A` / `--forward-agent` to request forwarding and `-a` / `--no-forward-agent` to disable forwarding for a workspace. Agent forwarding remains opt-in because forwarded agents can be used by processes on the remote host while the SSH session is active. |
| `remote-daemon-status` | Print bundled remote daemon version, asset, checksum, and cache status. |
| `ssh-session-list` | List persisted SSH PTY sessions for one remote workspace or all remote workspaces. Supports `--json`. |

### Workspace environment variables

A workspace can carry a set of user-defined environment variables that every
shell spawned in it inherits.

Setting them:

- CLI: `cmux new-workspace --env KEY=VALUE [--env ...] [--env-file <path>]`
  (and the same flags on `cmux workspace create`). `--env` is repeatable;
  `--env-file` reads `KEY=VALUE` lines (blank lines and `#` comments ignored, an
  optional leading `export ` stripped). When both are given, `--env` overrides a
  value from a file.
- Project config (`cmux.json`): an `env` object on a workspace definition, e.g.
  `{ "name": "Build", "cwd": ".", "env": { "AWS_PROFILE": "prod" } }`.
- Socket: the `workspace_env` param on `workspace.create`.

Inspecting them: `cmux workspace env [<handle>] [--mask] [--json]` prints the
configured set. `--mask` redacts the values so secrets are not echoed in full.
The env set is intentionally omitted from `workspace list` output so a plain
listing never leaks secrets.

Semantics:

- **Inheritance.** The variables apply to the workspace's initial shell and to
  every pane, surface, and split created later in that workspace — no per-pane
  re-export. They are also re-applied to every shell recreated on session
  restore.
- **Persistence.** They are stored on the workspace in the session manifest, so
  they survive app restart, daemon restart, and session restore.
- **Precedence.** Workspace env overlays the inherited process environment. It is
  applied as the shell's startup environment, so it is visible to login-shell
  init files (`~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`) as they run, but any `export` those
  files perform for the same key wins for the interactive session (they run after
  the variable is seeded). An explicit per-surface environment (a layout
  `surfaces[].env`, SSH startup env) overrides the workspace value for that
  surface.
- **Protected `CMUX_*` variables.** Workspace env can never override the managed
  variables cmux injects (e.g. `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID`, `CMUX_SURFACE_ID`,
  `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`, `CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD`) or the terminal identity variables
  (`TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `TERM_PROGRAM`); those keys are protected at spawn time
  and silently win.
- **Secrets.** Values may be secrets. They are never logged, are masked by
  `--mask`, and are kept out of `workspace list`. Prefer `--env-file` so secrets
  do not land in shell history. Note that values stored in the session manifest
  live on disk in plaintext.

`events.stream` is a v2 socket method advertised by `capabilities`. The first
response frame is an `ack`; sequence resume metadata lives under `ack.resume` as
`after_seq`, `oldest_seq`, `latest_seq`, `next_seq`, and `gap`. Event frames
carry a process-local monotonic `seq` and a stable `id` for dedupe. Clients
should persist `seq` after processing each event and reconnect with that value.
See [events.md](events.md) for the full protocol and event catalog. Every emitted event is also appended to
`~/.cmuxterm/events.jsonl`, including model lifecycle events for window
creation, close, focus, key-window state, workspace selection, pane focus, and
surface selection, focus, creation, or closure. The stream is bounded: cmux keeps
4,096 replay events in memory, caps each encoded event frame at 16 KiB, closes
slow subscribers after 1,024 pending events, and rotates `events.jsonl` with one
16 MiB archive at `events.jsonl.1`.

## No-Socket Negative Help Probes

The following probes must not print help. They protect argument forwarding after
`--`, where a forwarded `--help` token belongs to the command payload.

<!-- cli-contract-negative-help-probes:start -->
- `cmux vm exec demo -- --help` !> `Usage: cmux vm`
<!-- cli-contract-negative-help-probes:end -->

## Current Help Caveats

These are current contracts to preserve until a follow-up PR intentionally
changes them:

- `cmux version --help` currently prints the version summary because `version`
  is handled before subcommand help dispatch.
- `cmux claude-teams --help` is handled by the command launcher, not by the
  pre-socket help dispatcher.
- `cmux codex-teams --help` is handled by the command launcher, not by the
  pre-socket help dispatcher.
- `cmux remote-daemon-status --help` currently prints status because the command
  runs before subcommand help dispatch.

## ArgumentParser Migration Sequence

1. Keep this contract file and `tests/test_cli_contract_help.py` green.
2. Add Swift ArgumentParser as a dependency without changing behavior.
3. Introduce a parse-only facade that maps ArgumentParser command structs onto
   existing `CMUXCLI` runner methods.
4. Move one command family at a time into small files, starting with no-socket
   commands (`version`, `themes`, hook installers), then socket commands, then
   browser and tmux compatibility.
5. After each family moves, run the contract probes plus targeted socket tests in
   GitHub Actions.
6. When all command families are migrated, remove the manual global parser and
   legacy helper code that no longer owns behavior.
