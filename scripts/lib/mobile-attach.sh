# URL against the tagged debug socket. Sourced by scripts/dev-setup.sh,
# scripts/mobile-dev-launch.sh, and the reload scripts so the bundle-id / socket
# derivation and the mint RPC live in exactly ONE place (they MUST match

# naming); a locale-sensitive class would keep non-ASCII letters the slug drops.
