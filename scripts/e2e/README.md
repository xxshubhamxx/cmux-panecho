# scripts/e2e - iOS E2E drivers

Driver contract for [.github/workflows/ios-e2e.yml](../../.github/workflows/ios-e2e.yml).
The workflow owns runner selection, tailnet join, the per-run backend, both
app builds, relay-only configuration, simulator lifecycle, evidence upload,
and cleanup. `ios-e2e-run.sh` owns the six terminal steps after the apps are
signed in, paired, and connected.

## backend-up.sh and backend-env.sh

`backend-up.sh up` starts this run's backend on the Linux runner: the iroh-v2
and presence Workers in local workerd, Postgres, and iroh-relay behind
`tls-forward.mjs` on the runner's tailnet address, with per-phase timings in
the step summary. `backend-up.sh hold` serves until `CMUX_E2E_BACKEND_DONE_FILE`
appears, and `backend-up.sh down` removes everything `up` created.
`backend-env.sh env` prints the app-side origins, `hosts` and `unhosts` map
and unmap the fixed name in `/etc/hosts`, and `wait` blocks until both Workers
answer. Contract:
[docs/ci/ios-e2e.md](../../docs/ci/ios-e2e.md#per-run-backend).

## ios-e2e-run.sh

Drives an already signed-in, paired, connected simulator through the six-step
terminal script against a real streamed terminal. The workflow owns sign-in,
pairing, and connection setup; the driver receives the run identity and
simulator explicitly through flags.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--tag <tag>` | Shared Mac/iOS dev tag; pairing is tag-scoped. |
| `--sim-udid <udid>` | Exact booted simulator owned by this run. The driver passes this UDID to every simctl call. |
| `--evidence-dir <dir>` | Directory for screenshots, streamed-grid text dumps, and device logs. The workflow uploads it verbatim (`if: always()`). |
| `--bundle-id <id>` | Optional installed bundle override. Without it, the driver discovers the isolated `dev.cmux.*` bundle on the simulator. |
| `--step-timeout <seconds>` | Optional bounded wait per terminal step; default 45 seconds. |

| Env | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CMUX_E2E_TAG` | Same shared tag as the Mac host. Pairing is tag-scoped, so a tag mismatch cannot pair. |
| `CMUX_E2E_SIM_UDID` | The freshly created, booted simulator this run owns. Pass it to every simctl and AXe call; never resolve by name. |
| `CMUX_E2E_EVIDENCE_DIR` | Directory for screenshots, streamed-grid text dumps, device logs, and step timings. The workflow uploads it verbatim, including on failure. |
| `CMUX_IROH_V2_BASE_URL`, `CMUX_PRESENCE_BASE_URL` | This run's backend origins from `backend-env.sh env`, baked into both app builds. |
| `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_EMAIL` / `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_PASSWORD` | Same account used by the Mac and simulator. The workflow stores it as `CMUX_UITEST_*` in a mode `0600` file for the `agent` profile. |
| `CMUX_E2E_BACKGROUND_SECONDS` | Optional background interval for the replay step. Set to `120` or more to enforce the two-second app-side scene-active-to-terminal-frame budget and write `background.json`; the file also retains the end-to-end resume-to-Mac-input timing. |
| `CMUX_E2E_VIDEO` | Optional simulator video output path. The driver records the whole run and stops the recorder during cleanup. |

The workflow sets `CMUX_IROH_V2_FORCE_RELAY=1` for the Mac build and writes the
relay-only defaults for both installed app bundles before
`mobile-dev-launch.sh` starts the simulator. The driver assumes that policy is
already configured; it does not switch transport modes during a step.

`iroh-codex-workload.sh` starts three real `codex --yolo -m gpt-5.5-mini` sessions in separate Mac workspaces and two supporting workspaces. It records workspace, surface, model, and observed output markers in `codex-workload.jsonl`; set `CMUX_CODEX_DURATION_SECONDS` to keep the sessions active while the iOS gate runs.

On failure exit nonzero and print `E2E FAIL step=<id>` as the last stderr line,
where `<id>` is a step id below or `sign-in`, `pair`, `connect` for setup.

### The six-step terminal script

Each step covers a shipped regression; do not weaken a step without replacing
its coverage.

1. `marker-1` - type `echo E2E-<run>-A` into the streamed terminal and assert
   the echoed marker renders in the grid within a bounded wait. Proves the
   full live keystroke path: iOS key -> Iroh -> Mac PTY -> stream -> grid.
   Regression: input echo stall, caught only by marker-echo liveness
   ([#12927](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12927)).
2. `burst-scrollback` - run `seq 1 5000`, wait for the tail, scroll back and
   assert an early line and the final line are both intact. Proves ordered
   byte-tee append and scrollback integrity under burst output.
   Regression: O(chunk^2) byte-tee append and viewport livelock
   ([#13432](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/13432)).
3. `alt-screen` - open `less` on a real file, assert the alt-screen UI
   rendered, quit with `q`, and assert the primary screen is restored.
   Regression: alt-screen transition freeze
   ([#12844](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/12844)).
4. `interrupt` - start `sleep 30`, send Ctrl-C, and assert the prompt returns.
   Proves control-byte delivery independently of the output path.
5. `replay` - background the iOS app, relaunch it, and assert the reconnected
   grid replays the missed content rather than staying blank.
   Regression: a black-holed QUIC path kept installed and left the terminal
   blank on replay ([#14030](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14030)).
6. `marker-2` - type `echo E2E-<run>-B` and assert it echoes. Proves the
   session is still live for input after reconnect and recovery.
   Regression: a pre-bootstrap recovery cooldown stalled a fresh session
   ([#14124](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/14124)).

The workflow stops the tagged Mac app, deletes the isolated simulator, removes
the tagged backend stack, and deletes the temporary credentials file after the
driver exits, including on failure.
