# Lint: every Swift file under cmuxTests/ must be wired into
# cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.
#
# A test file added to the worktree but not registered as a PBXFileReference +
# PBXSourcesBuildPhase entry in project.pbxproj is silently ignored by Xcode and
# never compiles or runs on CI. Both bot reviews and
# `xcodebuild test -only-testing:cmuxTests/<TestClass>` pass with
# "Executed 0 tests" — so missing wiring is indistinguishable from a passing
# regression test until a real user hits the bug the test was supposed to catch.
#
# Originally surfaced during the https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4529
# investigation, where SessionIndexJSONLStreamTests.swift on
# https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/4536 looked like a clean two-commit
# red/green test fix but never actually ran on CI.
#
# The same check covers app source directories: `--target cmux --tests-dir
# Sources --recursive --allowlist scripts/pbxproj-sources-wiring-allowlist.txt`
# fails when a Sources/**/*.swift file is not compiled into the app target.
# That is how main stopped compiling on 2026-09-25: a merge dropped
# AgentChatProseStreamWakeDriver.swift from the cmux target while code on main
# still used its types.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/lint-pbxproj-test-wiring.sh [--repo-root <path>]
#       [--target <name>] [--tests-dir <dir>] [--recursive]
#       [--allowlist <file>]
#
#   --recursive   check *.swift in every subdirectory, not just the top level.
#   --allowlist   file of repo-relative paths that are deliberately not target
#                 members, one per line, `#` comments allowed. An entry whose
#                 file is gone or is now wired fails, so the list cannot rot.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all test files wired correctly (or no test files present)
#   1 — at least one test file is missing pbxproj wiring
#   2 — invocation error (e.g. project.pbxproj not found)

# Locate the cmuxTests PBXNativeTarget and resolve its Sources build phase
# UUID. We then slice out just that build phase block and look for files inside
# it — which is exactly the set of files Xcode compiles into cmuxTests.
#
# Targeting the cmuxTests Sources phase specifically (instead of the whole
# pbxproj) catches three failure modes:
#   1. File missing entirely (no `<file>.swift in Sources` anywhere).
#   2. File has a PBXFileReference + group child but no PBXBuildFile /
#      Sources phase entry (in the project tree but not a member of any
#      target).
#   3. File is a member of the wrong target (e.g. cmuxUITests or cmux). Its
#      `<file>.swift in Sources` lines exist in the pbxproj, so a global grep
#      would pass, but they are not inside the cmuxTests Sources block.
# `/* cmuxTests */ = {` appears twice in a typical pbxproj: once for the
# PBXGroup that holds the test files, and once for the PBXNativeTarget. We
