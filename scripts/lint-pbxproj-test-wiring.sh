# Lint: every Swift file under cmuxTests/ must be wired into
# cmux.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj.
#
# A test file added to the worktree but not registered as a PBXFileReference +
# PBXSourcesBuildPhase entry in project.pbxproj is silently ignored by Xcode and
# never compiles or runs on CI. Both bot reviews and
# `xcodebuild test -only-testing:cmuxTests/<TestClass>` pass with
# "Executed 0 tests" — so missing wiring is indistinguishable from a passing
# regression test until a real user hits the bug the test was supposed to catch.
#
# Originally surfaced during the https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4529
# investigation, where SessionIndexJSONLStreamTests.swift on
# https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/4536 looked like a clean two-commit
# red/green test fix but never actually ran on CI.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/lint-pbxproj-test-wiring.sh [--repo-root <path>]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all test files wired correctly (or no test files present)
#   1 — at least one test file is missing pbxproj wiring
#   2 — invocation error (e.g. project.pbxproj not found)

# Locate the cmuxTests PBXNativeTarget and resolve its Sources build phase
# UUID. We then slice out just that build phase block and look for files inside
# it — which is exactly the set of files Xcode compiles into cmuxTests.
#
# Targeting the cmuxTests Sources phase specifically (instead of the whole
# pbxproj) catches three failure modes:
#   1. File missing entirely (no `<file>.swift in Sources` anywhere).
#   2. File has a PBXFileReference + group child but no PBXBuildFile /
#      Sources phase entry (in the project tree but not a member of any
#      target).
#   3. File is a member of the wrong target (e.g. cmuxUITests or cmux). Its
#      `<file>.swift in Sources` lines exist in the pbxproj, so a global grep
#      would pass, but they are not inside the cmuxTests Sources block.
# `/* cmuxTests */ = {` appears twice in a typical pbxproj: once for the
# PBXGroup that holds the test files, and once for the PBXNativeTarget. We
# only care about the native-target block. Use awk to capture every
# `/* cmuxTests */ = { ... };` block and keep only the one whose `isa =
