# Fails if remote-tmux gains a new sleep, timer, or poll loop.
#
# Remote-tmux waits on things constantly — a control-mode reply, a shared master, a person
# finishing a login — and every one of those has an event to wait on. A timer instead of the
# event is not a style preference: its interval is dead time a frozen mirror spends after the
# thing it was waiting for already happened, and it can miss the event entirely.
#
# This exists because knowing that is not enough. A reviewer caught a `Task.sleep` backoff in
# the login waiter that had shipped with a comment claiming "there is no event to subscribe
# to" — the event was the ControlMaster socket being created, and `FileWatcher` had been in
# the tree the whole time. Nothing failed when that went in, so nothing will fail the next
# time either, unless something checks.
#
# Adding a wait that genuinely has no edge is allowed, but it has to be listed below with the
# reason, which makes the exception visible in review instead of implicit in a diff.
#
# Usage: scripts/lint-remote-tmux-no-polling.sh
# Exit 0 when clean, 1 with the offending file:line otherwise, 2 when the scan itself failed.

# Primitives that make a wait time-based rather than event-based. `.sleep` and `.asyncAfter`
# are matched on their own so the receiver's shape does not matter: Task, Thread, a
# ContinuousClock built inline or a clock held in a property, DispatchQueue.main, .global(),
# a named queue, all count. The opening parenthesis is part of the match, with any spaces
# before it, because `usleep (5)` is the same call as `usleep(5)`. It has to be on the same
# line: Swift does not read a parenthesis at the start of the next line as a call (the compiler
# reports the function as unused), so that shape cannot hide a wait. Requiring the parenthesis
# also keeps an enum case `.sleep` and an injected `self.sleep = sleep` from reading as waits.

# Waits that predate this guard, recorded so it blocks NEW ones without pretending the

# particular, since sizing convergence is supposed to be driven by tmux's ordered
# %begin/%end acknowledgements rather than a wall clock. Removing an entry from this list
# is progress; adding one needs the reason to say why no edge exists.
#
# Each entry names ONE wait: file, enclosing function, and the wait's own line with
# whitespace collapsed. A second sleep added to a baselined function is therefore new and
# fails; moving the existing one to another line number is not. Regenerate with

# second wait added to the same function is new and fails, so every exception shows up in
# review with its own reason. Only waits that exist in the tree belong here.

Waiting on a timer means the event that ends the wait was not used. Find the edge first:
  - a control-mode reply            -> sendTracked / the %begin/%end correlation
  - a file or socket appearing      -> FileWatcher (watches the parent directory too, so
                                       creation is visible for a path that does not exist yet)
  - terminal output, e.g. a marker  -> the per-surface PTY tee detectors
  - a workspace closing             -> the TabManager close path calls the controller
An event-driven wait must also check its condition once up front: an edge that already
happened is never delivered.

If there is genuinely no edge, add the wait to ALLOW in this script: its key line, then the reason.
