# Drags a window's bottom edge and checks that the terminal's scrollback does
# not grow. Repeated height changes used to leak rows: a shrink pushes the top
# of the screen into history, and the matching grow appends blank rows instead
# of pulling those rows back, so scrolling up showed the same lines again.
#
# Two things have to be true for the leak to happen, and both took a while to
# get right. The screen must be full, so the shrink has no blank rows to trim
# and has to push real content. And something above the terminal must repaint
# at the new size, or the leak is only trailing blanks, which read-screen
# strips and no check can see. tmux supplies the repaint, but only with the
# alternate screen turned off -- on the alternate screen there is no history to
# push into and the resize path is never reached.
#
# The verdict is scrollback growth. Duplicate lines are reported but not
# graded: tmux's repaint writes a second copy of the visible rows whether or
# not the terminal is fixed, so duplicates appear either way. Measured over 8
# cycles: 400 lines becomes 437 on a terminal without the fix and 402 with it.
#
# The window is driven through cmux's own resize-window verb. AppleScript
# cannot do it: from an automation host every app, cmux included, reports zero
# windows through System Events for lack of Accessibility permission.
#
# Sequencing waits on observable edges, not fixed delays. The debug CLI is a
# snapshot interface -- the only way to see the terminal is to read it -- so
# each edge is a marker or state the screen must reach, re-read until it
# appears, bounded by a deadline that fails the run instead of passing it.
