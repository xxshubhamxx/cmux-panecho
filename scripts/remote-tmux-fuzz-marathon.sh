# Long unattended run of the live layout fuzz: many seeds, evidence capture,
# automatic recovery. Every failure or hang leaves enough on disk to
# reproduce and diagnose it: the seed and iteration, the fuzz log, the app's
# debug log tail, and — for hangs — a process sample taken while stuck.
#
# Usage: CMUX_TAG=main scripts/remote-tmux-fuzz-marathon.sh <ssh-host> [seeds] [iters-per-seed]
# Set CMUX_FUZZ_RELAUNCH_HOST only when the app must be opened through a
# separate login host; by default the marathon relaunches it locally.
# Output: a private /tmp/cmux-fuzz-marathon.XXXXXXXX/ directory printed at start.
