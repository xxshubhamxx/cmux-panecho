"""Coverage guard: every top-level CLI verb is in `docs/cli-contract.md`.

`docs/cli-contract.md` is the contract an agent reads to find out what the cmux
CLI can do. A verb that is not in it is a verb nobody finds, and nothing else
notices the gap: a new verb in the top-level dispatch ships a working command
whose only documentation is help text you have to already know to ask for. An
agent-reachability audit read this file, concluded that saved layouts had no CLI
path, and was wrong only because `cmux layout` had never been written down.

So the guard reads both sides and fails until they agree:

  * the dispatch: every top-level verb routed inside `CMUXCLI.run()`. There are
    several routes and all of them count. Most verbs are `case "…"` arms of
    `switch command`, but roughly a third are handled before the switch is
    reached, and those early routes come in three shapes: `if command == "…"`,
    `if command == SomeType.someConstant`, and `SomeType(command: command, …)`,
    an initializer that returns nil unless it recognizes the verb. `cmux diff`
    and `cmux version` are the first shape; the sudo broker entrypoints are the
    second; the owned-process supervisors are the third. A guard that read only
    the switch would be blind to the cheapest way to add a verb to this file.
  * the contract: the first cell of every row of every table whose first
    header cell is `Command`, where one cell may name a verb and its aliases. A
    verb documented with its family (the tmux compatibility set, the `vm` and
    `surface` subcommand tables) counts as documented. Rows of the document's
    other tables do not count: they list flags, environment variables and JSON
    fields, and a field named `state`, `delete` or `sessions` must not vouch for
    a verb of that name.

There is deliberately no exemption list. The table already carries internal
entrypoints (`vm-pty-attach`, `__tmux-compat`) as one-line "Internal …" rows,
which is cheaper than an inventory file and keeps one place to look. A verb an
agent should not call is still a verb someone will meet in a stack trace.

The dispatch parse refuses to go quiet:

  * a case arm whose pattern is not a comma-separated list of string literals
    fails the guard by name, so a pattern shape this script cannot read is a
    failure instead of a silently skipped verb.
  * a `command ==` whose right side is neither a string literal nor a resolvable
    `Type.constant` fails by line. Skipping it was how four hidden verbs stayed
    out of the contract: the guard matched only literals, so a comparison
    against a named constant read as no comparison at all.
  * a named type in either of the two indirect shapes is resolved by reading the
    file that declares it, and failing to find that file, the constant or any
    verb in it is a failure too. Nothing here is hard-coded to a type name.
  * a missing `func run()` or `switch command` fails for the same reason: a
    rename must break the guard, not turn it into a no-op.
  * braces are counted over code only, with string literals (including
    multiline and raw ones) and comments blanked first, and the line that closes
    the switch has to look like the close of a switch. A stray `}` inside a
    message string used to end the scan early and drop every arm after it while
    still reporting success.

What this guard does NOT claim: that every documented row still dispatches. The
table documents subcommands (`window displays`), verbs routed inside a
namespace, and legacy spellings, so the reverse direction is not a clean
comparison and is left to review.

Usage:
    scripts/check-cli-contract-verbs.py [--root PATH]

Exit codes:
    0  every dispatched verb appears in the contract
    1  an undocumented verb, an unreadable dispatch shape, a missing anchor, or
       an unreadable input
