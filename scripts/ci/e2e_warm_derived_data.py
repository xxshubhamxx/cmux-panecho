"""Let an E2E build start from the last DerivedData main compiled.

    e2e_warm_derived_data.py record WORKSPACE MANIFEST
    e2e_warm_derived_data.py replay WORKSPACE MANIFEST
    e2e_warm_derived_data.py restore WORKSPACE DERIVED_DATA KEY

The compiled product archive carries Build/Products only. Without the build
database and intermediates next to it, xcodebuild cannot tell what is already
built, so a revision that changes one test file recompiles the whole app host:
691 of the 735 seconds `build-for-testing` spends is the app scheme.

Xcode decides what to rebuild from modification times, and a fresh checkout
stamps every file with the checkout time. `record` writes the content digest
and modification time of every build input before a compile. `replay` restores
the recorded time only onto files whose content is byte-identical, so an
unchanged file looks as old as the build that consumed it, and stamps every
other file with the current time. A changed file cannot keep an old time: files
unpacked from an archive (GhosttyKit, SwiftPM binary artifacts) carry the
archive's times, which may predate the producer's build. Correctness never depends on how close
the adopted DerivedData is to this revision; distance only costs compile time.

A time derived from content alone (no manifest) would be unsafe. llbuild
compares stat info for equality, but swift-driver treats a clang header or
module as changed only when it is newer than the last build's start, or with
explicit modules than the module it built, and hashing does not change that.
On Xcode 26.6 a header edited to an older time reran SwiftDriver and still
built with the old header value, with explicit modules on and off; stamped
now, it rebuilt. A time and size shared by two contents also
kept the stale product. Canary: manaflow-ai/cmux actions run 36023385114.

Directories are inputs too. Xcode signs a folder input such as
`Assets.xcassets` by the times of everything in it, the directories included,
so a checkout-time directory reruns the asset catalog, regenerates
`GeneratedAssetSymbols.swift` and recompiles every `cmuxTests` file: 241 s
against 50 s for an app source edit, measured on #14235. `record` also keeps
each directory's time under `<path>/`, beside a digest of its entry names, and
`replay` restores it only where those names are unchanged. Every file in it
still carries its own replayed time, so a changed file inside keeps the folder
out of date.

`restore` adopts the newest DerivedData archive for KEY that a `main` run of
this workflow published. Any miss, expiry or transfer failure is a cold build.
