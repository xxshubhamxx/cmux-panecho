"""Name the merge that stopped main's app or tests from compiling, within minutes.

Nothing here gates a merge. It runs after the fact, reads builds that already
happen, and makes a red main actionable.

The fast lane is seed-derived-data.yml: every push to main already compiles
the app-host test product (the app and cmuxTests, build-for-testing, no test
run) incrementally on the trusted warm minis first, Blacksmith beside them.
Its seed job's `Build` step is the compile verdict for that commit, so this
adds no Mac time per merge. A seed job whose Build fails dispatches the
attribution at once, instead of waiting for the slowest pool to finish the run.
main-compile-probe.yml compiles one main commit the seeds skipped, only when a
break's range holds more than one merge; its `Compile` step is read the same way.

`analyze` (read-only token) walks main's first-parent history back from its
head to the newest commit whose compile is known, reading each commit's seed
and probe runs:

  green    a run that concluded success (a seed skipped by decide builds the
           inputs of an earlier green seed, so it is green too), or any job
           whose compile step succeeded
  red      a job whose compile step failed with source `error:` lines (the
           errors are the evidence; a Build failure with none is a machine
           failure, not a verdict, and stays unknown)
  unknown  cancelled, replaced while pending, or still running

For each compiler error at the newest red commit it finds where the error
first appeared: the known commit before it lacks the error (or is green).
Errors are keyed by file and message, not line, so an unrelated edit above
them does not make an old error look new. A range of one merge names that
pull request (confirmed). A longer range names the merges whose diff touched
an erroring file, or a symbol an error names (suspected), and lists the
commits in it to probe, so the next analysis narrows it to one.

`report` (write token) comments once on each culprit pull request with the
errors, pinging the author and merger, and dispatches the probes. Its job name
is the headline (`culprit: Seed DerivedData red since #N by @a, merged by
@m`), which ci-dash reads from the build controller's webhook feed. `plan-fix`
decides whether the fixer runs (a culprit, main's head still red with the same
errors, and nobody's open pull request already fixing it); the fixer (a Claude
run limited to reading and editing files) makes a minimal fix-forward, and
`finish` opens it as a pull request with auto-merge (its own CI is the fast
check), or, when the fixer declines, a labeled revert pull request of a
confirmed culprit, which a person merges.
