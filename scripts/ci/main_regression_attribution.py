"""Name the merged pull requests behind tests that newly fail on main.

main_full_suite.py keeps one issue open while main's full suite is red, but a
red run lists failing jobs, not what broke them, and nobody is told. This
reads a red full-suite run and finds its new failures: app-host tests the
shard ratchet reported as RATCHET_NEW_FAILURE, or xcodebuild listed under
"Failing tests:" in a batch the ratchet does not grade, that are not in the
known-failures catalog and did not fail in the previous full-suite run whose app-host
shards all finished. A failure in a shard that run did not fully grade (a
dedicated lane failed first, or the batch stopped early) is listed as having
no baseline instead. Such a run is only used while the test list and shard
packing are unchanged; otherwise an older, fully graded run is the baseline,
and tests the skipped runs saw failing are not new either.

A batch whose app host xcodebuild restarted (the app crashed, exited or hit a
test timeout) records the test that was running as failed. That test did not
regress: the app died under it. The test in flight at the restart (started in
the live log, never finished) is reported as "the app host crashed while
running it", with the crash signature the log shows (the objc, Swift or
uncaught-exception message before the backtrace), or the diagnostics
artifact to read when the log has none. Every other failure of that batch is
an ordinary failure. When the baseline or a run skipped on the way to it
already showed every signature of the crash, the crash is pre-existing: it
is listed once as recurring and pings nobody, whichever test it hit this
time. A crash with no signature, or with a signature no earlier run showed,
is new.

Each new failure is attributed to the commits between the two runs' head
SHAs, mapped to the pull requests merged into main by those commits. Each
pull request, including the only one in the range, is ranked by whether its
diff reaches the failing test's suite: 2 when it edits the suite
(test_impact.py), 1 when a changed app declaration or string, or a changed
localized string (reverse_test_impact.literal_suites), is named by the suite
(reverse_test_impact.py), 0 otherwise. The top score names the suspects; when
every score is 0 the failure is left unattributed, with the reason, rather
than blaming the range. A tie lists pull requests labeled merged-unverified
(merge_receipt.py: a judging check was not green when they merged) first.

`report` writes a "New since" markdown section for the tracking issue (read
by main_full_suite.py report --extra-section) and comments once on each
suspect pull request, idempotent through a hidden marker keyed on the pull
request and its failing test set, and once per commit range. A test tied between more than
MAX_PINGED_SUSPECTS pull requests is listed in the issue only. The section
ends with a hidden data marker (DATA_PREFIX): the failures, their suspects,
and the commits in the range that can change an app-host test's outcome.
main_regression_bisect.py reads it to rerun and bisect each failure. A new
crash's victims are included with `"crash": true`, so a crash from a pull
request the ranking missed is still bisected; a recurring crash's are not.
Nothing is reverted or re-run here.
