"""Tell a test run the Mac failed apart from one the code failed.

A run whose log shows one of these runner-level errors and no started test
never asked the tests anything, so running the same commit again is a fair
retry rather than a reprint of a known answer. Both the focused dispatcher's
repeat guard (dispatch-focused-test.py) and the main regression bisect read
this, so "machine failure" means one thing everywhere.

Add a signature only for an error that happens before the first test starts
and that the code under test cannot cause. "never finished bootstrapping" is
not one: an app-hosted test prints it when cmux itself crashes at launch.
