"""Pick the macOS pool the unsigned iOS jobs land on.

test-ios.yml (mobile-core-package, ios-simulator-build, ios-simulator) and
ios-screenshots.yml (screenshots) run this in a `runner` job, the way
test-e2e.yml runs e2e_runner_pool.py, and every macOS job of the run reads its
outputs.

The choice is the E2E rule (e2e_runner_pool.decide(), which calls pull
request CI's pr_runner_pool.decide()), limited to one question: may this run
take an owned Mac? Owned Macs are `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>` pools
(pr_runner_pool.persistent). The answer is yes only when all of these hold:

    vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED == '1'   the fleet switch pull requests and E2E read
    vars.CI_IOS_OWNED == '1'       this lane's own switch (IOS_OWNED_VARIABLE)
    `runner` is auto               an explicit runner is never rerouted
    the default is the 6vcpu       MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS, then MACOS_RUNNER_IOS,
      macOS 26 pool                  names blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
    no `ios_version`               the minis carry one iOS 26.x runtime; another
                                     version would download a platform onto a
                                     shared machine
    not an App Store upload        the upload writes the ASC key to $HOME
    not a release call             release runs stay on Blacksmith
    no `seed_cache`                seeding runs in the ci-cache-writer
                                     environment with the R2 write keys
    the lane is measured           ios-screenshots.yml is a reusable workflow
                                     that release.yml calls with only
                                     `contents: read`, so its runner job cannot
                                     hold the `actions: read` the queue snapshot
                                     needs; it reaches the minis only on request
    the pool has room              LANES[lane].jobs owned machines are free
                                     live, or without the live read the pull
                                     request rule places them on an owned
                                     pool within its queue rounds (below)
    the simulators have room       SIM_LABEL has the run's simulator jobs free

Otherwise the run keeps the default, exactly as before: when the picker would
have chosen a Blacksmith pool (12vcpu overflow, say), iOS still takes its own
variable, so MACOS_RUNNER_IOS keeps meaning what it meant.

Queue rounds. The pool rule is pull request CI's with its
vars.CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS (`--queue-rounds`): an owned pool takes the run
while its jobs start there within that many job lengths, whatever
Blacksmith's wait, and the queue stays within machines x (1 + rounds)
(pr_runner_pool.owned_room()). Without the rounds the picker used the kill
switch rule, which counts every in-flight run's whole future peak (the
janitor's `committed`) as taken now: on 2026-09-25 (run 36136190497) that read
43 of 32 std machines taken while 8 ran, so the run went to the 6vcpu macOS
26 pool with 62 jobs queued and waited 15 minutes there. `--queue-rounds 0`
restores that rule; a caller that omits the flag gets it too.
ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml gives a test-ios.yml run's owned jobs the same queue
allowance as a CI run's before it moves them. The simulators are not queued
for: SIM_LABEL must have the run's simulator jobs free now.

Live capacity. test-ios.yml mints the org's glaeda-route App token (as ci.yml
does) for same-repository runs and passes it as ROUTE_TOKEN. With it, "free"
is read from live state, not estimated from run titles. Each in-flight
test-ios.yml and ios-screenshots.yml run of the last SIM_WINDOW_MINUTES (only
those two workflows hold simulators) is charged what its jobs show it holds
or will take on the owned pool (hold()), and nothing else. ios-screenshots.yml
runs are known by their workflow path and need one machine and one simulator.

    a job running on an owned runner   already shows as a busy runner; a
                                         simulator job (SIM_JOB) also holds its
                                         mini's simulator
    a queued job on an owned label     one machine, and a simulator if it is
                                         a simulator job
    simulator jobs not created yet     one simulator each, and a machine each
                                         beyond the one a running build frees;
                                         none once the build failed
    a run placed owned, no jobs yet    its whole need from its title
    a run still picking                its whole need: it may yet go owned
    a run on Blacksmith                nothing: a re-run, a named Blacksmith
                                         pool, macOS jobs on a Blacksmith label,
                                         or a finished picker without a marker

The pool is its online idle runners (pr_runner_pool.live_owned_free()) less
the machines charged. Simulators are counted per mini, not per runner: every
runner instance of a simulator mini carries SIM_LABEL (`<member>-glaeda`,
`<member>-glaeda-K`), and the mini runs one simulator job at a time, so an
idle runner says nothing about its simulator. The free simulators are the
online SIM_LABEL minis of the pool that no running simulator job holds, at
most CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS' SIM_LABEL entry less those held, less the
simulators charged. Neither count goes below zero. live_placements() lists
the markers, reads the jobs of the runs they and age leave open (at most
MAX_JOB_READS, newest first), and lists one more page of markers when a run
read has a finished picker the first listing did not mark, so a picker that
finishes between the reads is never taken for Blacksmith. A run left unread
is charged its title's need, the machines only within
pr_runner_pool.LIVE_WINDOW_MINUTES (after that its jobs show busy).
Until 2026-09-28 every run was charged its whole need from its title, the
simulators for SIM_WINDOW_MINUTES and the machines for
pr_runner_pool.LIVE_WINDOW_MINUTES, wherever it went: a burst of pull
request runs, each sent to Blacksmith within a minute, read as "-2
glaeda-ios-sim free" and a pool of -1 while std runners, root and side, sat
idle, so every run behind them overflowed too, and a run whose simulators had
finished still held them. The run takes the pool `runner: owned` takes when
both counts cover it; otherwise it keeps the default. The janitor snapshot is
not read. On 2026-09-25 the snapshot
estimate, which charges every newer pull request run it cannot place,
counted the owned pool full while 20 of its runners sat idle. Without the
token, or when the runners cannot be listed or none carries the pool label,
the snapshot rules below decide.

Simulator capacity. glaeda puts SIM_LABEL (`glaeda-ios-sim`) on the runners of
minis that have an iOS simulator role and an iOS 26.x runtime, and runs one
simulator job at a time on each such mini (a second is refused). Its count is
CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS' SIM_LABEL entry (`{"glaeda-ios-sim": 2}`, read by
pr_runner_pool.capability_slots()), one simulator job per machine; without the
entry the lane never takes the fleet on its own. What is taken comes from the
queue janitor's snapshot, which counts every queued or running job carrying
the label and each run's capability marker (queue_janitor.capability_marker),
plus every test-ios.yml and ios-screenshots.yml run created since the snapshot
and still in flight, charged the simulator jobs its title says it needs
(charged_sim_jobs()): none for a Swift package run or one dispatched to a named
Blacksmith pool, one for a single device family, else MAX_SIM_JOBS. A run
whose title does not parse is charged in full.

Where an `auto` run went. Its title says `auto` wherever the picker sent it,
so the runs it sent to Blacksmith would otherwise be charged simulators they
never hold. On 2026-09-25 that kept the picker at "-5 of 8 free" with nine
simulator minis idle: every run it sent to Blacksmith was charged two
simulators, so the next run went to Blacksmith too. A run the picker put on
the owned pool uploads the fixed-name `owned-pool-watch` marker (the rescue
sweeper's), so a listing of that name (owned_placements(), at most
MARKER_PAGES pages) says which runs took the fleet. An `auto` run without it is charged nothing once its runner
job has had PLACEMENT_GRACE_MINUTES to pick, and so is a re-run attempt,
which always takes the retry label. A run younger than that, a listing that
failed, or one older than the listing reaches is charged in full. (The live
path reads the runs' jobs instead; see Live capacity.)

Labels. ios-simulator-build and ios-simulator need the iOS runtime, and
screenshots too, so they ask for the owned pool label and SIM_LABEL together
(`runs_on`); the plain pool label alone never reaches them. mobile-core-package
runs SwiftPM tests on the host and needs no simulator, so it takes the pool
label alone (`package_runs_on`). glaeda knows these jobs (the build and package
jobs are isolated jobs, the simulator jobs hold its per-mini simulator token),
so unlike an E2E run they never take the root label. Neither label appears in
workflow text (tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh refuses `glaeda-` there):
runs-on reads the JSON this prints.

`runner: owned` forces the owned pool for the lane's Xcode pin
(vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR), without reading the queue, for a proof run. It
is an explicit request, so instead of falling back it fails the runner job
when the run could not be rescued or has nowhere to go: CI_PR_POOL_OWNED is
not 1 (ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml then never watches it, and a job left queued
would wait for good), or CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS gives SIM_LABEL no machines. It
also refuses what auto refuses: an `ios_version`, an upload, a release call
and `seed_cache`. CI_IOS_OWNED is not required, so a proof run can precede it.

A `swift_package` run of test-ios.yml runs mobile-core-package alone: one
machine and no simulator, so it needs no SIM_LABEL capacity.

A job left queued on the owned labels, or refused by glaeda at job start, is
re-run by ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml, which watches the run through the marker
the runner job uploads (as for E2E). From attempt 2 on every macOS job takes
`retry_runs_on`: the default when it is a Blacksmith pool, else the 6vcpu
macOS 26 pool.

API budget: the E2E picker's four requests, plus one page of runs for each
of the two iOS workflows and up to MARKER_PAGES pages of `owned-pool-watch`
markers; on the live path, four pages of in-flight runs, the marker pages,
one job listing for each run they and age leave open (at most MAX_JOB_READS),
and one more marker page when a run read was picked after the first listing.
Anything uncertain keeps the default.
