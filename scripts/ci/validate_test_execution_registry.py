"""Validate that every Python regression has a declared, live execution path.

Enforcement is scoped to the pull request that causes the problem.

A test file with no registry entry is a hard failure only when this pull
request is the one that added it (compared against the merge base). A test
that was already unregistered on the base branch is reported as a warning:
it is somebody else's oversight, and failing here would turn every open pull
request red for a reason its author cannot fix.

Everything a pull request can only break by editing the registry itself --
malformed entries, unknown fields, entries pointing at files that no longer
exist, lanes no workflow runs -- stays a hard failure.

`--write` registers every unregistered test whose lane can be derived (a
workflow already runs the file) and leaves the rest for a person to place.
The pre-commit hook runs it, so wiring a new test into ci-guards.yml is
enough to register it.

Duplicate registrations sit between the two. Two pull requests that each
register the same test merge cleanly into a duplicate nobody wrote, so a
duplicate already present on the base branch warns and one this branch
introduces fails.
