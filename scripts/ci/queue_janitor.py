"""Cancel macOS runner demand that no longer buys anything.

Pull request macOS jobs share a few small runner pools (Blacksmith and
GitHub-hosted macOS 15 and 26). When one is saturated, every queued job on it
that nobody will read delays one that somebody will. This janitor looks at
in-flight Actions runs and cancels runs that are waste, in this priority
order. Stale pull request runs (b) are cancelled on every sweep; the other
categories only when the number of macOS jobs queued on a pool they hold
exceeds a threshold:

  a. push-triggered experiment workflows on ``exp/*`` branches;
  b. pull request runs whose PR is closed or merged, or whose head SHA is no
     longer the PR head (superseded);
  c. full-suite CI runs whose PR no longer carries the ``full-ci`` label, once
     a newer CI run for that PR is already waiting to replace them and the old
     run's compile admission is not mid-flight (ci.yml deliberately lets that
     compile finish so the queued run can reuse its product).
  d. CI runs whose required ``ci-status`` is already decided against them:
     ``macOS compile admission`` or an ``app-host unit tests`` shard has
     concluded ``failure``, so the ``macos``
     reusable-workflow call cannot report ``success`` or ``skipped`` and no
     later job can take that back, while sibling macOS jobs still hold the
     pool. Unlike (a)-(c) the run is current and its remaining output is still
     readable, so this category is ordered last and never touches a run whose
     diff changes what the failing shard does.

Draft pull requests are deliberately not a category: a draft can be an active
integration branch other work depends on, and ci.yml has no ready_for_review
trigger to replace a cancelled ci-status.

A pool is the set of macOS labels a job asked for. Outside (b), a run that only
waits on a pool that is not backed up is never cancelled: its output may still
be read, and cancelling it frees nothing anyone is waiting for. A stale pull
request run's output is never read, so it goes whatever the queue, unless
someone re-ran it or labelled the PR no-janitor; those wait for a backed-up
pool like the other categories. Outside (b), candidates are skipped once every
pool's projected queue is back under the threshold. Every category shares the
per-sweep cancel cap, and runs holding a backed-up pool are spent first. Main pushes, merge groups, scheduled and
dispatched runs on main, release/tag runs, nightly, and TestFlight/App Store
workflows are never candidates, whatever their state.

Everything that decides is a pure function over already-fetched JSON; the
GitHub client at the bottom only fetches and cancels.

Every sweep can also write what it saw per pool (``--pool-load``): queued and
running macOS jobs, the oldest queued job's age, and the queued jobs that
belong to release or nightly runs. ci-queue-janitor.yml uploads it as the
``macos-pool-load`` artifact, and pr_runner_pool.py reads the newest one to
pick a pull request run's pool (and, through it, e2e_runner_pool.py an E2E
run's) without listing every in-flight run's jobs itself.

An owned Mac pool (``glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>``) is one more pool
here: stale pull request runs (b) on it are cancelled whatever its queue,
which frees minis, and the other categories only while it is backed up. With
CI_PR_POOL_OWNED on, the snapshot also carries each owned pool's
``committed`` machines: the owned machines each run holding it declared at
its peak (the jobs it placed there, not the whole run) in its
``macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`` marker, read with one
artifact listing per run that may hold one.

Orphaned runs are a separate pass (find_orphans): a job the runner scheduler
lost holds nothing on any pool, so that pass ignores the queue threshold,
has its own cap, and may end main schedules, nightly and TestFlight runs,
which the categories above never touch.

    A pool is a job's single runner label when it asked for one, which is
    every Blacksmith job, so pr_runner_pool.py can look a label up directly.
    Only jobs waiting for a runner count as queued; a `waiting` job is held
    by an environment approval and asks no pool for anything yet.
    `reserved_queued` counts the queued jobs of release and nightly runs; it
    is what tells a pull request to stay off a pool those runs are waiting on.
    `settings` carries the pool-choice repository variables, which a fork
    pull request's run cannot read itself.

    A job on an owned pool (`glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`) is keyed by
    that label (runner_pool); its counts are how pr_runner_pool.py knows how
    many of the pool's machines are taken. An owned pool also gets
    `committed`: for each run holding it, the larger of the jobs seen there
    and the peak its marker declares (`markers`, run id -> (pool, jobs, placed)), so
    a run whose later jobs do not exist yet still counts them. A job on an
    owned pool's root runners (`glaeda-root-...`) counts toward both the root
    label and the pool (counted_pools()), and so does its run's marker
    (marker_peaks()), so the picker reads free root runners and free machines
    from one snapshot.

    A job that also asked for a capability label (glaeda-ios-sim, see
    capabilities()) counts toward that label as well, and a run's capability
    marker (`capability_markers`, run id -> (label, jobs)) sets its
    `committed` the same way, so ios_runner_pool.py reads the simulator
    machines taken. Every job carrying the label counts, whether it holds a
    simulator or not, so the count errs toward Blacksmith.
