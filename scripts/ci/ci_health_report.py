"""Measure where CI time goes, so waste stops being something people discover by hand.

Everything that has ever been found about this repo's CI waste -- a macOS pool
that saturates near a dozen concurrent jobs while queue waits run into hours,
runs cancelled after they had already paid for macOS minutes, a full suite red
for days, workflows whose runs are almost entirely skipped, nightly rebuilding
on every main push, reruns of a tree nobody changed -- was found by somebody
querying the Actions API by hand. This report asks those questions on a
schedule instead.

It only measures. Cancelling wasted demand is scripts/ci/queue_janitor.py's
job (#13721); this script deliberately has no write access to runs, and reuses
the janitor's `parse_time`, `is_macos_job` and `linux_only_workflow_paths`
helpers rather than restating them.

What it reports for a window:

  * runner minutes by workflow, by job and by runner label, split by
    conclusion (success, failure, cancelled, skipped);
  * queue wait (created -> started) percentiles per runner label, which is the
    number that separates "our builds got slower" from "the pool is capped";
  * wasteful patterns: runs cancelled after real macOS work, one job failing
    across unrelated heads (a main-broken signal, not a flaky PR), workflows
    whose runs are overwhelmingly skipped, and repeat runs of an unchanged
    tree;
  * the same headline numbers for the previous window, so a regression shows
    up as a change rather than as a number nobody has a baseline for.

API usage is bounded by page caps rather than by time: nothing is cached, the
call count is stated in the summary, and a rate limit or API failure degrades
the report to partial data instead of failing the run.

Every function above `GitHub` is pure over already-fetched JSON, which is what
tests/test_ci_health_report.py exercises over fixtures.
