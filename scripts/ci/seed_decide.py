"""Decide which pools this main push must build a DerivedData seed on.

    seed_decide.py --repository OWNER/REPO --pool POOL=XCODE_APP [--pool ...]
                   [--event-name NAME] [--github-output PATH]

A pool may skip the Mac only when a seed with this push's exact build inputs
already exists for it, because pull requests then adopt that seed by prefix.
Comparing with the parent commit alone assumed the parent had a seed. It often
had none: seed-derived-data.yml never cancels a running seed, so a newer push
replaces the pending run, and the replaced commit is never built. The next push
that changed nothing but docs then skipped too, and main's newest seed stayed
on an older build for as long as such pushes kept arriving. On 2026-09-24, 8 of
22 skips left main 2 to 6 commits past its newest seed with different inputs,
including 80 minutes after #14241 merged.

So for each pool, walk main's first-parent history to the nearest commit whose
seeder run saved that pool's seed, and skip that pool only if that commit's
build inputs, under the pool's own Xcode, equal this one's. Each pool decides
alone: a macOS 15 seed that keeps failing must not make every push rebuild the
macOS 26 seeds too. Anything unknown (API errors, no seeded ancestor within
the window, a commit outside the shallow checkout) builds that pool.

A pool may be a lane `LABEL@K`: the same runners, building in the second (or
Kth) canonical root, /private/tmp/cmux-ci-K. That root is part of the seed
key, so an owned Mac's second compile slot only adopts a seed built there.

Far lanes. A pending seed that a newer push replaces is never built, which is
fine when the newer push is near it, and costly after a change that recompiles
the `cmux` module: on 2026-09-25 main took 271 pushes, 62 to 77% of each pool's
seed jobs were replaced, and admission started p50 6 to 11 commits (14 to 28
app Swift files) behind main. warm_distance.py measured what such a start costs:
within NEAR_APP_SWIFT_FILES app Swift files, with no package interface change
and no hot file, p50 140 s; otherwise p50 401 s. So each pool that builds also
gets a tier, from the nearest ancestor its seed covers (a saved seed, or a seed
job past its pending slot, which no push replaces) to this push, and `far` lists the
pools whose tier is not near. seed-derived-data.yml queues a far seed in a
second concurrency group per pool, so a newer near push never replaces it, and
it starts beside a running near seed instead of behind it. A newer far push
still replaces a pending far one (it holds the same change and more), so each
pool runs at most two seeds and keeps at most two pending. A far seed of an
older commit may then save after a newer near one, which moves R2's newest
pointer back; adoption walks history first, so only its fallback past the
ancestor window sees that. No covering seed
within the window is far; an error computing the tier is near, which is the
single lane of before.

Outputs `pools`, the JSON list of pools to build, in the order given, `matrix`,
the seed job's matrix over them (`pool`, plus `root` for a lane), `build`,
whether that list is empty, and `far`, the JSON list of those pools to seed in
the far lane.
