# resolve-cmux-tui-client-commit.sh — print the cmux-tui commit whose published client
# an app bundle should carry.
#
# The `cmux-tui artifacts` workflow publishes one client build per main commit that
# touches cmux-tui or its build inputs, at
# https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui/<commit>/manifest.json. The app workflows bundle the
# client of the newest such commit in the checked-out history.
#
# A bare `git log -1 -- <paths>` is wrong on CI: actions/checkout clones with depth 1,
# and in a one-commit history the grafted root shows every file as added, so the answer
# is always HEAD. HEAD has a published client only when it touched cmux-tui itself, so
# the download 404s on almost every push. This deepens a shallow clone until real
# cmux-tui history is visible, ignores shallow boundary commits, and walks candidates
# newest first until one has a published manifest.
#
# Candidates come from the full history, merge commits included, and are grouped by the
# content of the client inputs. The client depends only on that content, so any
# published commit in a group stands for all of it. Without this, a branch-side merge
# commit that reached main through a merge-commit PR (52020d35 via #14090) was the
# "newest" candidate while only the PR's main-side merge (f4b331d15) was published, and
# every reload build failed in exact mode.
#
# Usage: scripts/ci/resolve-cmux-tui-client-commit.sh [--max-fallback <n>] [--head <rev>]
#   --max-fallback <n>  older input versions (groups of commits with identical client
#                       inputs) that may stand in when no commit with newer inputs has a
#                       manifest yet (artifacts run failed or still running). Default 0: a
#                       commit with HEAD's exact inputs must be published, or this fails.
#   --head <rev>        history to search (default HEAD).
# Env: CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_MANIFEST_BASE (default https://files.cmux.com/cmux-tui),
#      CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_REMOTE (default origin; where a shallow clone deepens from),
#      CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_FETCH_ATTEMPTS (default 5; tries per deepen before giving up),
#      CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_FETCH_RETRY_SECONDS (default 2; first backoff, doubles per try),
#      CMUX_TUI_CLIENT_PROBE_RETRY_SECONDS (default 3; wait between manifest probes after
#      a transient failure; a 404 never waits).
# The chosen 40-hex commit is the only stdout line; diagnostics go to stderr.
