"""Keep swift-package-tests' SwiftPM build directories on an owned Mac between jobs.

    owned_spm_scratch.py link WORKSPACE [STORE]
    owned_spm_scratch.py evict [STORE]

swift-package-tests runs `swift test --package-path <package>` for the
packages a change selects. On an owned Mac (a glaeda runner) the workspace is
reused, but actions/checkout cleans it (`git clean -ffdx`), so every job
deleted each package's `.build` and built the package and its dependencies from
nothing: 206 to 594 MB per package on one mini on 2026-09-26, 1,430 runner-minutes
a day across the minis. The checkout keeps the modification times of files it
did not change, so a kept `.build` rebuilds only what the change touched.

`link` points each package's `.build` (every Package.swift under Packages/*/*
and vendor/bonsplit) at STORE/spm-scratch/<fingerprint>/<package path>, outside
the workspace, where the clean cannot reach. The fingerprint hashes
`xcodebuild -version`, `swift -version`, the workspace path and the vendored
bonsplit commit, so a build against another bonsplit is never reused, and another
Xcode (an upgrade, or a pull request's CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP) or another runner's
workspace never reuses modules another compiler built for another path.

A scratch directory in use is held by a shared flock on
STORE/spm-scratch/<fingerprint>.lock: `link` starts a small holder process that
keeps it until the runner ends the job (the runner kills a job's leftover
processes), or HOLD_SECONDS at most, past the job's timeout, should the runner
die mid-job and leave it. Before linking, `link` keeps the whole mini's scratch
under MAX_BYTES, dropping the least recently used directories first, whatever
runner or Xcode left them, and skipping any another job holds. `link` touches
the lock file, so its time is the directory's last use, and a directory's size
is kept in <fingerprint>.size, measured again only once the directory was used
after it and no job holds it, so a link walks only what changed since.
A directory is dropped by renaming it to .trash-* first, so a half-deleted one
is never reused; the next run sweeps what a killed removal left. `evict` drops
every directory no job holds, for disk tooling and for
owned_build_state.py's `keep` when it runs out of space. Any error leaves the
package to build as before.
