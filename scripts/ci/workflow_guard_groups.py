"""Ownership for the workflow-guard-tests Linux matrix.

Step ownership is read from ci-guards.yml itself: each step's
`if: ${{ matrix.group == '<group>' }}` names its group, and every path the
step's `run:` executes directly belongs to that group. Only inputs a step reads
indirectly are listed by hand in PATH_OWNERS.

Nothing here is a second copy of the workflow, so two pull requests that each
pass on their own cannot combine into a manifest that disagrees with it.

Unknown paths deliberately return None so the caller can fail open to every
group, and a workflow this module cannot read fails open to every group.
