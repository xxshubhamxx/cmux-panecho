"""Move a pull request CI run off a busy persistent macOS pool.

pr_runner_pool.py picks one pool per run. When that pool is owned (a
`glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>` label, pr_runner_pool.persistent), the jobs
it names in `owned_jobs` take it and the rest take retry_runner (Blacksmith).
GitHub never re-routes a queued job: one on the owned pool waits for it
however long the pool stays busy. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml runs this script
from the default branch, with Actions write, as one sweeper (SWEEP=1,
sweep()): it finds the runs placed on an owned pool by their fixed-name
markers and gives each a thread running follow(), the per-run watch described
below. A dispatch with a run's id (WATCH_RUN_ID) watches that run alone,
checked as a workflow_run event's run would be.

The script waits for ci.yml's `changes` job, which runs the picker. When the
picker chose a persistent pool, that job uploads a marker artifact
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run id>-<attempt>-<jobs>p<placed>-<pool>`, the counts and pool
for the janitor's count); no marker means the run is on an
ephemeral pool and the watch ends. Otherwise it watches the run's jobs until the
run finishes. If a job on the persistent pool is still queued with no runner
after the budget (CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS, 90 by default), it confirms the
pull request head has not moved, cancels the run, waits for it to finish, and
re-runs it. The re-run is attempt 2, which runs `changes` again: the picker
places it like attempt 1 without queueing (pr_runner_pool.LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT),
on the owned machines free now and Blacksmith for the rest. The sweeper finds
attempt 2 among the unfinished CI runs (owned_reruns()) and watches it the way
it watches attempt 1: it waits for `changes` and looks for attempt 2's own
marker (the marker name carries the attempt), because a macOS job gets its
label only after the picker has chosen, then for late-placement's. A job stuck
or refused there has its failed and cancelled jobs re-run on attempt 3, which
always takes Blacksmith.

An owned runner can also refuse a job it was handed: glaeda's job-started
hook exits 1 when the host is busy (its lock is held), and the job fails
within seconds, before any step of the workflow succeeds. GitHub does not
retry it, so the pull request would stay red until someone re-ran it. A job
on the persistent pool that failed within REFUSAL_SECONDS of starting, with
its runner setup step failed or no workflow step succeeded, counts as refused
(compile admission's `always()` metrics steps still succeed after a refusal).
A failed job that ran no step at all counts too, whatever its length: GitHub
fails a job whose runner went away only after 10 minutes ("The self-hosted
runner lost communication with the server"). A failed Select Xcode or Select
helper Xcode step also counts, without a time limit, because a missing pin is
a machine fault even when a helper build succeeded first. The watcher lets the rest of the
run finish, since GitHub re-runs no job of a run in progress and cancelling
it would kill every healthy sibling, then confirms the head has not moved and
re-runs its failed jobs. Only a run still going at the watch's end, or main's
full-suite run (whose failure would open main's red-CI issue), is cancelled
first.
That attempt 2 reuses attempt 1's outputs, so its owned jobs take the owned
labels again (a runner pinned on attempt 1 is not reused) and what already
passed (compile admission, say) is kept. A run on an owned pool is split across pools
anyway (per-job placement, CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_SPLIT), which is
sound only because both sides run the same Xcode: retry_runner is a macOS
26 pool on the lane's pin, the pin the owned label names, and on 2026-09-24
both the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu macOS 26 images reported
Xcode 26.6 build 17F113. If those builds ever differ, re-run the whole run
here instead (rescue with failed_only=False).

glaeda's hook does not refuse a job for the mini's capacity: it waits, with
no limit, inside the runner's setup until the units and tokens the job needs
are free. A job on the persistent pool still in its runner's setup
SETUP_WAIT_SECONDS after it started is stuck like a queued one: once no
sibling is still running (or the watch is about to end), the run is cancelled
and re-run the same way. Until then the job is not accepted, so the watch goes
on.

Attempt 2 goes back to the fleet whoever started it: the failure
attribution's re-run after a machine failure, this rescue's after a refusal
or a stuck queue, or a person's. The job takes the owned label, not the mini
that failed it: a runner that lost communication is offline, and a busy
mini's gui runner stops listening. A person's re-run of a pull request (a code
failure) goes back to the minis on any attempt. Neither has a marker of its
own; the sweeper finds them among the unfinished CI runs (owned_reruns()) and
watches them like attempt 1, and a job stuck or refused there gets the bot's
next re-run, which every runs-on sends to retry_runner (Blacksmith) from
attempt 3 on, so a refusal costs two re-runs at most.

E2E runs (test-e2e.yml) are watched the same way. Its `runner` job runs
e2e_runner_pool.py, which may pick an owned pool, and uploads the same marker
(with 1 job). An E2E run is a workflow_dispatch, not a pull request, so there
is no head to re-check, and its build and test jobs are not a split that can
break. A stuck or refused E2E job gets its failed and cancelled jobs re-run,
keeping a build that passed; those jobs keep attempt 1's pick, so they take
the runner job's retry_label, a macOS 26 Blacksmith pool on the same Xcode
build, and the follow-on watch of attempt 2 finds no owned job and stops.
A UI run's retry_label stays on its owned pool, since Blacksmith cannot run UI
tests (e2e_runner_pool.py), so the watch of attempt 2 may re-run it once more;
no attempt past 2 is watched, so it still never loops. A queued UI run moved
that way only rejoins the same owned queue, costing its place in it; the watch
stays for the refusals, which a re-run does clear. When the build itself did
not succeed, every job is re-run instead, so the `sibling` job looks again for
another run compiling the same revision (e2e_build_unfinished), and the runner
job picks again: attempt 2 takes that live pick, which may be an owned Mac,
because a Blacksmith re-run cannot adopt a product an owned Mac compiled (their
Rust toolchains differ) and so compiled it again. That attempt is followed like
a full re-run, by its picker and its own marker, and attempt 3 and later always
take retry_label. A stuck E2E run that finished some other way (a newer dispatch
in its concurrency group cancelled it) is not re-run, since that would cancel
the newer one. Its watch lasts E2E_WATCH_LIMIT_SECONDS, since its test job
queues only after a sibling wait and a build.

Main's full-suite dispatch of ci.yml (ci-main-full-suite.yml, a
workflow_dispatch on main) is watched exactly like a pull request run:
pr_runner_pool.py may put it on an owned pool like a pull request, and its
`changes` job uploads the
same marker. It has no pull request, so in place of the pull request head it
checks main's HEAD: once main has moved past the run's commit, a stuck run is
cancelled but not re-run, because its completion makes
ci-main-full-suite.yml dispatch the newer HEAD, and a re-run would only queue
the older commit behind it in main's CI concurrency group. A refused job's
failed jobs are re-run whether or not main moved, so a fleet refusal never
leaves main's run red.

Dispatches of test-ios.yml and ios-screenshots.yml are watched exactly like an
E2E run (DISPATCH_WORKFLOW_PATHS). Their `runner` job runs ios_runner_pool.py,
which may put the iOS jobs on an owned pool with the glaeda-ios-sim capability
label, and uploads the same marker; from attempt 2 on every macOS job takes
its retry_runs_on, the Blacksmith pool. A job asking for a capability label no
idle mini carries waits like any other queued owned job, so it is moved after
the same budget.

Dispatches of iroh-release-gate.yml are watched the same way. Its `runner`
job runs e2e_runner_pool.py for the Tailscale version-skew job alone, and
only takes an owned pool with a machine free now (no queue rounds), so that
job rarely waits. Its simulator-e2e jobs stay on Blacksmith, but they run in
the same run: a stuck owned job's rescue cancels them with it, and a refused
one's waits for them until the watch ends. The re-run of failed and
cancelled jobs keeps the modes that passed and puts everything on Blacksmith.

Side-lane workflows (SIDE_WORKFLOW_PATHS) have no picker. On attempt 1 of a
trusted run (a same-repository pull request, or a push, schedule or
workflow_dispatch, whose code is this repository's own branch; see
TRUSTED_SIDE_EVENTS), their small macOS jobs take vars.CI_LIGHT_LANE_RUNNER
(the light minis' side label) or vars.CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER (the std minis'),
both glaeda-side-* labels that only the minis' non-root runners carry. Attempt
2 and later take the job's Blacksmith default. So the first job on an owned label marks the run as on a persistent
pool (a job behind a Linux gate appears once the gate ends), and the watch
stops once every owned job has been accepted, which a side lane's few short
jobs reach in minutes. A refused side-lane job gets the run's failed jobs
re-run; a stuck one gets the run cancelled and its failed and cancelled jobs
re-run, keeping the jobs that had already finished. That re-run (attempt 2)
takes the lane's Blacksmith default, so the watch ends there. A
stuck run that finished some other way (a newer push cancelled it) is not
re-run. Its watch lasts SIDE_WATCH_LIMIT_SECONDS. A side-lane run that is not
a pull request has no head to move, like a dispatch. cmux-next.yml exists only
on the feat-cmux-next branch; its side-lane run uploads the owned-pool-watch
marker itself, so the sweeper adopts it like a picker's run.

Nightly builds (NIGHTLY_WORKFLOW_PATH) are watched like a side lane: there is
no picker, and attempt 1 of a push or schedule run on main puts
build-nightly-app on vars.CI_SEED_TRUSTED_POOL, the trusted owned pool
(glaeda-trusted-<class>-xcode-<version>, TRUSTED_LABEL), while every later
attempt takes Blacksmith. The trusted minis also seed DerivedData on every
push, so the job may wait behind a seed: its budget adds one QUEUE_ROUND_SECONDS
round. A stuck job gets the run cancelled and its failed and cancelled jobs
re-run; a refused one waits for the run to finish (the signing job is skipped
behind it) and then gets its failed jobs re-run. The run is not a pull request,
so in place of a head it checks for a newer nightly run on main that has not
finished: nightly.yml's concurrency group holds that run pending behind this
one, and a re-run would join the group and cancel it. With one, a stuck run is
cancelled and not re-run (so the newer run starts), and a refused one is left
as it is; the newer run builds main's newer HEAD.

A job stuck with no runner is not rescued while another job of its run is
running on a persistent runner, whatever the workflow: the rescue cancels the
whole run, which would move that job to Blacksmith too (#16463). The stuck
job waits until that job ends, and if the watch ends first, it stays queued
for the mini that frees up. A refused job, or one held in setup at the
watch's end, is still acted on as described above, running siblings or not.

A job's wait is measured from the later of its `created_at` and the first
time the watcher saw it queued, so a job record created before its `needs`
were met can never count as already past the budget.

It stops watching, doing nothing, when:
- owned pools are off (CI_PR_POOL_OWNED is not 1), before any API request;
- the run is not attempt 1 of a same-repository pull request run of ci.yml
  or a side-lane workflow, of a trusted non-PR run of a side-lane workflow, of
  main's full-suite dispatch of ci.yml, or of a dispatch in
  DISPATCH_WORKFLOW_PATHS;
- a side-lane run finished with no job on an owned label, or the fleet
  accepted all of its owned jobs;
- on a re-run of failed jobs, no job runs on an owned label once
  late-placement, if it re-ran, has finished;
- on a full re-run, `changes` and late-placement finished without that
  attempt's markers;
- `changes` finished without a marker: the run is on an ephemeral pool.
  When ci.yml started the watch for late placement (LATE_PLACEMENT=1), it
  first waits for ci-macos.yml's late-placement job and follows the run if
  that job uploaded its marker (it moved jobs onto owned root runners);
- the run finished, or the watch limit passed.

Request budget: the reads use a manaflow-glaeda-route App token when the
workflow could mint one (READ_TOKEN; its own 5000 requests an hour), else
GITHUB_TOKEN, which allows about 1000 requests an hour for the whole
repository. Cancels and re-runs always use GITHUB_TOKEN (GitHub.__doc__). A run on an ephemeral pool costs a jobs listing every
POLL_SECONDS until `changes` finishes (usually two or three) plus one artifact
listing. A run on a persistent pool adds a jobs listing every POLL_SECONDS
while one of its jobs waits for a runner and every IDLE_POLL_SECONDS otherwise,
about 30 in all for an hour-long run. A read that fails is retried
READ_ATTEMPTS times before the watch gives up; a failed cancel or re-run is
never retried.

A CI run's owned jobs may wait on purpose. pr_runner_pool.py puts a run on
an owned pool while its jobs are expected to start there no later than on
Blacksmith, and within CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS job lengths (default 1, at
most MAX_QUEUE_ROUNDS). No idle machine is held for jobs a run creates later
(its shards): they join the label's queue behind whatever arrived meanwhile,
and the picker keeps that queue within machines x (1 + rounds) by every
run's peak. So any owned job of a CI run may wait up to about that long, and
its budget is the pool's expected wait plus a margin:
CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS plus QUEUE_ROUND_SECONDS per round
(queue_seconds(), 900 seconds by default, so 990 in all), under the watch limit so a stuck
job is still moved. With the rounds at 0 the picker takes an owned pool
only with machines free now, and the budget is the configured one. A
test-ios.yml or test-e2e.yml run's picker queues by the same rounds, so it
gets the same allowance, on every attempt: a re-run of failed jobs queues on
the owned labels like attempt 1's jobs. The configured budget alone is an iOS
screenshots or side-lane run's (#14391: no picker; the side lanes share the
runners PR runs queue on, so they are moved to Blacksmith more often).
