"""Move a run's post-admission jobs onto owned root runners that are idle now.

pr_runner_pool.py places every macOS job of a run when the run starts. The
jobs after compile admission (the app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag and
cli-product-tests) only start once admission finishes, often ten minutes
later. If the owned pool was full at the start, they are committed to
Blacksmith (admission's pool, or pr_retry_runner) and wait in its queue even
when root runners have drained in the meantime.

ci-macos.yml's late-placement job runs this after admission succeeds, for a
same-repository pull request: on attempt 1, and on a re-run that runs compile
admission again (a full re-run, or a re-run of a failed admission). A re-run
of failed jobs after admission keeps the outputs of the attempt before, so
ci-macos.yml takes `runners` only in the attempt that made it (output
`attempt`), and those jobs take their owned labels.
It reads the idle root runners live through the org route App and gives
each job that is not already owned the root label, in owned priority order,
up to that many idle runners. The shards and friends then run
test-without-building on the mini against admission's uploaded products, as
they do after an owned admission; they never compile.

When a runner carries the pool's gui label (pr_runner_pool.gui_label(): one
gui runner per mini), the jobs that hold the
gui token (pr_runner_pool.gui_token_job(): the shards, tests-build-and-lag,
cli-product-tests) take that label instead, one per idle gui runner, and the other jobs the root
label, one per idle root runner: each mini runs one GUI job at a time.

Overflow off a full gui pool: each mini has one gui runner, so the gui label
has about ten machines, and the picker charges a run's gui-token jobs to the
std pool's forty-odd. When the picker owned some of this run's gui-token
jobs and the gui runners idle now cannot take them all, this counts the jobs
already queued on the gui label and on RETRY_RUNNER, the Blacksmith pool the
picker named for this run (gui_backlog(): the jobs of in-flight CI runs,
oldest runs first). Minis first: a job an idle gui runner takes now stays.
Every other one goes where it is expected to start sooner, in seconds: on the
gui label behind the backlog on its online runners (GUI_JOB_SECONDS a job), or
on RETRY_RUNNER after its start latency (BLACKSMITH_START_SECONDS) behind its
queue on RETRY_RUNNER's label capacity (RETRY_JOB_SECONDS a job). A tie stays
on the minis. There is no fixed allowance of queue on the gui label: until
2026-09-29 a job stayed while it started within one gui job length
(GUI_QUEUE_ROUNDS), whatever Blacksmith's queue, and over the 24 hours to
10:00Z that day the gui label queued a p50 202 s and p90 1014 s (988 jobs,
base 3 s), its runners 10 to 12 of 12 busy every hour from 20:00Z, while on
2026-09-27 164 of the 193 gui jobs that waited over 300 s were created while
a Blacksmith macOS pool had nothing queued. Blacksmith is not free capacity:
from 07:00 to 10:30Z on 2026-09-28 it ran 22 macOS jobs at most across its
three pools with a median of 100 queued behind them, and the post-admission
jobs moved there after an owned admission waited 18.4 minutes on average
against 5.6 for those that stayed, which is why a move needs the RETRY_RUNNER
backlog to say Blacksmith starts the job sooner. With CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS at 0 (the kill
switch) no job queues on purpose. With no gui runner idle and either the kill
switch on or no gui runner online, every owned gui job moves without a read.
Otherwise an unreadable backlog moves nothing.

Output `runners` is a JSON object from job key (shard-N, lag, cli-product)
to label. Any failure prints a warning and outputs {} (no change).
