"""Which runner labels this repository may use, applied to values rather than text.

`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` already decides this for workflow *text*:
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` refuses a `runs-on:` naming a physical
fleet host, a Tart VM, or a paid label outside the approved set. Every guard in
this repository works the same way, on files.

Runner choice does not live in files. It lives in `MACOS_RUNNER_*` repository
variables, and a variable's value never appears in a diff, so none of those
guards can see it. `warp-macos-26-arm64-12x` sat in the release and large-nightly runner
variables from 2026-09-20 to 2026-09-23 even though
the guard rejects that exact label on sight -- it matches the `macos-26` fleet
pattern and is absent from the allow-list.

This module applies the guard's own patterns to a label value. It does not keep
a second copy of them: it reads them out of the guard script, and
`tests/test_runner_label_policy.py` fails if that read stops working, so the
two cannot drift apart.
