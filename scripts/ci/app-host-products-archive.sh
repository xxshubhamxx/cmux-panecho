# Pack and unpack the compiled app-host test products that CI passes between
# jobs. The archive is an Apple Archive compressed with LZFSE: /usr/bin/aa
# ships with macOS and compresses on every core, where `tar -z` uses one.
#
# Symbolic links are preserved. A link is portable when its target is relative
# and has no `..` component, because such a link can only resolve below its own
# directory and therefore inside Build/Products. `pack` replaces every other
# resolvable link (absolute, or climbing with `..`) with a copy of its target,
# only after checking that all reachable targets belong to Build/Products or
# Build/Intermediates.noindex. Other inputs must be staged explicitly first.
# The archive never depends on files outside the archived tree.
# Dangling unportable links are dropped because they cannot be useful to the
# restored product and could resolve against paths on the consuming runner.
