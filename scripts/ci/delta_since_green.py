"""Route a pull request from its last green head when the new head only merged main.

RFC #14631, slice 2. When a pull request's head H2 is its previous head H1
plus one or more merges of main, and at most one commit on top (the conflict
resolution), the pull request's own changes already passed CI at H1. What can
change a test's outcome is what differs between H1 and the tree this run
tests, so ci.yml routes diff(H1, merge) instead of diff(main, merge).

H1 is the nearest commit on H2's first-parent chain with a conclusive
`ci-status` check run from a pull_request run of ci.yml that GitHub ties to
this pull request and base branch; every such run must have passed. Every commit
between them must be a merge whose second parent is on main, except H2 itself,
which may be one ordinary commit on top of such a merge.

Fail open. Anything unexpected (another shape, a red or missing verdict, a
force push, history too shallow, a pull request that edits CI policy, an
API error) prints why and leaves
`base_sha` empty, and ci.yml routes the usual pull request diff. The result
also never drops a file the pull request's own diff needs: every file the
pull request changes against main must either differ since H1 or have been
part of the pull request's diff at H1, which H1's green run covered. And
it never routes more than the pull request's own diff, nor main's
cmuxUITests/ edits, which would fail the pull request's suite-coverage check.

Stdlib only: ci.yml runs the copy on the base revision, like the trusted
router, so a pull request cannot change how its own diff is chosen.
