    - the host: `macos` is the host's major version. The compilers come from
      Xcode, not from the host, so a point release of the host cannot change
      what they emit; the major version stays in so that a product never
      crosses to a host the lane has not been validated on.

      directory it was compiled into. A product compiled under a checkout
      carries that checkout's absolute path, which differs by pool, so it only
      matches another job at the same path. A product compiled at the
