"""Pick the macOS pool a pull request CI run lands on.

ci.yml's `changes` job calls this once per run, and every pull-request macOS
job in the run reads the answer: compile admission, the app-host consumers
that follow it, tests-build-and-lag, cli-product-tests, the Claude wrapper
and remote daemon lanes. A run on a Blacksmith pool is never split across
pools, because the app-host product only loads under the Xcode that linked it
(#14163). A run on an owned pool may be, per job (see "Per-job placement"
below).

The run goes where it expects to wait least (pick()):

    vars.CI_PR_POOL_ORDER, comma-separated; by default
      blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26   same macOS and Xcode as the lane, faster
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26    vars.MACOS_RUNNER_PR today
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15    macOS 15 Xcode (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15),
                                   the pool and Xcode main's own CI runs on

    expected wait = that label's queued jobs over its Blacksmith plan capacity,
                    times a job's length there (JOB_MINUTES: 12vcpu jobs run
                    about twice as fast), plus COLD_ROUNDS on the macOS 15
                    pool, which has no DerivedData seed for its Xcode and
                    compiles cold

Owned pools come first in the default order and take the run while the jobs
they would hold start within vars.CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS job lengths
(default 1, at most MAX_QUEUE_ROUNDS) and within the queue bound
(owned_room()), whatever Blacksmith's expected wait: Blacksmith is overflow.
Comparing with that wait, read from a snapshot up to MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES old,
sent runs off minis busy for a few minutes whenever a Blacksmith pool had
looked free. Otherwise the Blacksmith pool with the least expected wait takes
it, the earlier in the order on a tie.

The wait counts what holds a label now: jobs queued and running, and each
run since the snapshot at what it holds (young_charge(): admission and its
side lanes while it is younger than a job length, its whole peak after, when
its shards exist). So a run's shards that do not exist yet hold no idle mini:
a later run takes it, the shards join the label's queue when they exist, and
GitHub hands out runners in queue order. On 2026-09-25, 31 of 36 owned std
runners sat idle while 21 jobs queued on Blacksmith for 5 to 12 minutes,
because every in-flight run's future jobs held machines at its peak ("-5 of
15 root runners free"). The bound keeps those future jobs from growing the
queue without limit: everything the runs holding a label will need at their
peak (the janitor's `committed`, and the markers of runs since) plus this
run's peak stays within machines x (1 + rounds).

`CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS == '0'` is the kill switch and restores the old rule
exactly: an owned pool only when the run's peak is free counting every run's
peak (committed and markers), then the first Blacksmith pool with a free
machine (or at most vars.CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED jobs queued once it arrives),
and when every pool is full the one whose queue is shortest in rounds (a cold
pool counting COLD_ROUNDS more). A pool
holding a queued release or nightly job
is never chosen: pull requests must not delay those. Every Blacksmith pool
is sponsored, so cost is not a reason to prefer one.

`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW == '0'` turns this off. Only the labels in POOLS
are accepted, because each one's Xcode pin is known here.

Owned Macs (fleet RFC, cmuxterm-hq#573) join as class pools keyed by the
label glaeda issues, `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`. glaeda puts that label
only on a dedicated member whose Xcode at the pinned path reports the pinned
build, so the one label carries the class, the availability and the Xcode.
The version follows the pull-request lane's pin (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR,
`/Applications/Xcode_26.6.app` -> `glaeda-std-xcode-26.6`), so moving the
pin moves the pool, and no runner carries the new label until glaeda has
verified the new Xcode on it. Owned pools are persistent: the machine
outlives the job. They take part only when `vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED == '1'`,
and then go first in the default order so Blacksmith is overflow. Their
capacity is the number of machines the fleet manifest gives each label,
published as vars.CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS (JSON, `{"glaeda-std-xcode-26.6": 12}`;
`{"std": 12}` and a bare `12` mean the same for the lane's Xcode pin).
The janitor's snapshot counts the jobs queued and running on each owned label
from the job listings it already makes, and `committed`: what the runs
holding the pool need at their peak, read from the marker each one uploads
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`). No token beyond
GITHUB_TOKEN is needed. A run replayed since the snapshot (its pick not
known yet) counts REPLAYED_RUN_JOBS on the owned pool it could take and one
on its root runners. With the rounds at 0 every run counts its whole peak
against the machines, as before (owned_free()). An owned pool is
skipped when it has no slot count, and like every pool when the snapshot is
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES. With the org route App's token, the runners
API (this repository's and the org's glaeda-minis group, GitHub.runners())
gives the online runners carrying each label, its capacity, and the
idle ones among them; every other online runner counts as busy
(live_pools()); a label with no idle runner is charged the
snapshot's queue, less what its machines finished since, and one job per run
since it, since the API shows no queue.
Read live, in-flight runs' peaks (`committed`, the markers' peaks beyond the
live window) are not charged at all: those are the fallback without the
runners API. With the runners read, attempt 1 does not need the snapshot
either: when it cannot be downloaded or is stale, the owned pools are
decided from the runners alone and Blacksmith's queues count as unknown
(empty): a run that no owned pool takes keeps every job's default, as
before. Read live, the queue bound counts the peaks of the runs of the last
DEFAULT_JOB_MINUTES that took the pool (their shards are on the way).
A job on an owned pool may therefore wait up to about CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS
job lengths, and ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml gives a CI run's jobs that much
(QUEUE_ROUND_SECONDS per round) on top of its budget before it moves the
run to Blacksmith (owned_pool_rescue.py). Without the runners API an
offline machine still counts toward capacity; what that gets wrong,
ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml catches: a run whose
job waits on an owned pool past its budget is re-run on Blacksmith. A re-run
of failed jobs reuses this run's outputs, so a persistent choice also names
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool every macOS job of such a re-run takes
from attempt 3 on (LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT). The owned order is `std` (48 GB minis),
then `light` (16 GB), then the Blacksmith pools: one order for every job type.

Per-job placement (`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_SPLIT == '1'`): without it, a run
takes an owned pool only when its whole peak fits, so a full suite on 9
idle minis with 2 busy went to Blacksmith entirely and queued there. With it,
when no owned pool fits the whole run, the run takes the owned pool with the
most room (at least one job), and `owned_jobs` names the jobs that fit,
in priority order (priority()): compile admission first (the heavy compile,
and a mini keeps its warm DerivedData), then the GUI jobs (app-host shards by
index, tests-build-and-lag), which queue longest on Blacksmith, then the light
jobs (cli-product-tests, the remote daemon and Claude wrapper lanes, and
swift-package-tests when it builds no Release helper; see run_plan()).
Each job counts one machine; the jobs after admission reuse its machine.
Every other job of attempt 1 takes
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool on the lane's Xcode. The shards and
cli-product-tests then run compile admission's product on another pool, which
is sound only because both run the same Xcode: the owned label names the
lane's pin, and on 2026-09-24 the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu
macOS 26 images all reported Xcode 26.6 build 17F113. The product only ever
moves from a mini to Blacksmith (admission is always placed first), and
app_host_test_products.check_xcode refuses a product linked by a newer Xcode
than the consumer's, so a drift fails closed instead of crashing in dlopen.
With the split off, a run takes an owned pool only when all its
owned-eligible jobs fit.

Root jobs: compile admission, the app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag and
cli-product-tests (and any job glaeda does not know) each hold one of a
mini's canonical roots. A class has `canonicalRoots` of them per mini (two on
a std mini, root-1 and root-2), and a compile takes any free root. The first
`canonicalRoots` runners of each mini are its root runners and carry
`glaeda-root-<class>-xcode-<version>` (root_label()); the others are its side
runners. GitHub hands a pool-label job to any free runner, so a root job on
the pool label could land on a mini whose roots were all taken and cost a
rescue re-run; on the root label it waits for a free root runner instead.
Two compiles can still share one mini's roots (see "Spread-first admission"
below). CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS gives the root runners' count beside the pool's
(`{"std": 40, "root-std": 20}`). A pool with
a root count sends its placed root jobs (ROOT_JOBS) to the `root_runner`
output, and place() puts no more of them there than its root runners have
room for, by the same expected wait; a
pool without one keeps the pool label for every job. A root job also holds
one of the pool's machines, so it counts against both.

Side lanes (the Claude wrapper, remote daemon and package lanes, light jobs
that never touch a canonical root) take the pool's side label,
`glaeda-side-<class>-xcode-<version>` (side_label()), the other runners of
each mini, whenever the pool has a root count and more machines than root
runners (the `side_runner` output). On the pool label a side lane landed on a
root runner about half the time (11 of 21 on 2026-09-25, 06:30 to 09:00Z,
3,300 s of root-runner time) and kept a compile or product consumer off that
mini's root while it ran; on cmux7s and cmux9s, with one root, it blocked the
mini's only compile. A pool without a root count keeps the pool label.
The light pool's side runners come first (light_side_lanes()): on attempt 1
of a same-repository pull request whose pick is an owned pool, as many side
lanes as the light side runners idle now take the light side label (the
`light_side_runner` and `light_side_jobs` outputs), and the picked pool
places the rest beside admission and what follows it. The light minis sat
almost idle (about 1% of their runner time over the 7 days to 2026-09-27)
while side lanes held std side runners, because a run takes one owned pool
and std, first in the order with the most room, always won. Placing the
lanes all or nothing kept them off light whenever one of its two side
runners was busy or offline, and most runs have two side lanes.

Warm affinity: an owned Mac keeps compile admission's DerivedData
(owned_build_state.py), and the queue janitor's snapshot carries `warm`: for
each root runner, the main commits its kept build starts from cheaply
(owned_warm_state.py, from the `owned-warm-keys` artifact admission uploads).
When `vars.CI_OWNED_WARM == '1'`, admission is placed on a pool with a root
count and the runners were read live, the picker routes by cost
(warm_distance.picker_route()): each online runner of that root label that
carries its own static label, `glaeda-runner-<runner name>`
(glaeda-cmux-runner gives every root runner one at install), costs its
expected wait (0 when idle, else what its current job has left, from the
snapshot's `running`) plus the compile predicted for its start: a kept build
of this run's merge base (MERGED_ONTO, the merge commit's first parent), of
this pull request (`pr-<PR_NUMBER>`, a re-push), or neither, by the pull
request's own distance tier (scripts/ci/warm-distance-model.json). The root
label costs the cold compile, plus a wait when every online root runner is
busy. When a warm runner is cheapest by ROUTE_MARGIN_SECONDS it
writes `admission_runner`, the JSON array `["<root label>",
"glaeda-runner-<name>"]`, which admission's attempt 1 takes as its runs-on;
a busy one only within the wait CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS lets the rescue
allow. Otherwise it is empty and admission takes the root label. Nothing
writes a runner label at job time, so the routing App needs only
"Self-hosted runners: Read-only". A warm runner taken between the pick and
the queue leaves admission waiting on its label, and
ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml moves it to Blacksmith.

Distance routing (`vars.CI_OWNED_WARM_DISTANCE`, on unless '0'): the exact
keys above miss most warm starts (on 2026-09-26/27 a near kept build sat on
another, free mini for about a quarter of admissions). With it on, each
admission artifact also carries its mini's root stamps (`roots`:
merged_onto, pr and the pull request's own app Swift files), the builds kept
since the snapshot are folded in live (owned_warm_state.live_warm(), at most
1 + 2 * LIVE_MAX_NEW requests), and warm_distance.picker_distance_route()
scores every free root on every mini with glaeda's hook's near/far/rebuild
tiers (main's diff from each kept merge base, from one blobless shallow
fetch, plus the kept and this pull request's own files). The root label
costs the mean of the idle root runners' costs (where GitHub would put it);
the cheapest runner is pinned when it beats that by ROUTE_MARGIN_SECONDS,
ties broken by cost, then the less loaded mini, then the name. The
`admission_route` output carries the candidates, the pick and its predicted
seconds (warm_distance.route_record()), which admission records.

Spread-first admission (`vars.CI_OWNED_SPREAD == '1'`, off by default): a
std mini has two root runners and a compile takes either free root, so two
compiles (8 to 10 of the mini's 14 cores each) can share a mini while another
mini's root runners sit idle. This picker only names the warm runners, by
tier (`admission_warm`, warm_tiers(): the merge base's, then the pull
request's); ci-macos.yml's admission-placement job, which admission waits
for, re-reads the runners just before admission queues and pins it to an
idle root runner on a mini none of whose root runners is busy
(spread_admission_runner(), admission_placement.py), preferring a warm mini.
With no such mini it takes an idle warm runner, then the root label. Picking
there instead of here keeps other runs' late placement from taking the pinned
runner between the pick and the queue.

GUI jobs (app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag) take an owned pool unless
`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_GUI == '0'`: the minis' runners are LaunchAgents in
the logged-in user's Aqua session, and each mini runs one job at a time. With
it 0 they take `retry_runner`. A compile admission on an owned pool runs the
changed suites itself when it can take its mini's gui token (take-gui in
ci-macos.yml) and otherwise leaves them to shard 8, so the plan always counts
that shard. On a pool with a root
count whose gui label (`glaeda-gui-<class>-xcode-<version>`, one runner per mini) has a count in
CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS, the placed gui-token jobs (gui_token_job(): the GUI jobs and cli-product) take
the `gui_runner` output instead of the root label (gui_runner()), so each mini gets at most the one
such job its gui token allows. A run's owned peak
(`jobs`, and the marker's) counts only the jobs that may take the pool.

The queue comes from the queue janitor, which lists every in-flight run's
jobs each sweep and publishes what it saw as the `macos-pool-load` artifact.
Only a copy uploaded by a run on main of this repository counts, so no other
branch can steer the choice. The janitor sweeps every 10 to 30 minutes, so
every pull request run created since the snapshot is replayed through the
same rule first, one job each, filling a pool's idle slots (its capacity
less what is running) before they count as queued, so a burst of pushes
spreads across the pools instead of all taking the one that looked idle. That costs three
API requests (the artifact listing, its download redirect, and one page of
CI runs); listing jobs here would cost one per in-flight run on every push,
out of the GITHUB_TOKEN's shared budget of about 1000 an hour. A snapshot
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES counts as unknown.

A pull request from a fork into manaflow-ai/cmux gets no repository
variables. It follows the settings and lane the janitor copied into the
snapshot (so the kill switch reaches it too), never pins an Xcode (each job
selects the newest SDK 26 Xcode on the pool it lands on, and the product
consumers restate compile admission's empty pin), and only lands on
ephemeral Blacksmith pools.

Re-runs (LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT below): attempt 2 is placed like attempt 1,
whoever started it, and a person's re-run of a pull request on any attempt.
A full re-run picks here again without queueing (rounds 0): the owned pools
only for the jobs that fit on machines free now, Blacksmith for the rest. A
re-run of failed jobs keeps this attempt's outputs and its owned jobs take the
owned labels again. github-actions[bot]'s attempt 2 follows a host fault on
one mini (a refusal, a stuck queue, a machine failure), not on the fleet:
until 2026-09-28 it took Blacksmith, where from 09-27 to 09-28 its macOS jobs
queued a p50 of 9 and a p90 of 61 minutes while the minis ran about half
busy. The rescue watches attempt 2 like attempt 1, and its re-run of a job
stuck or refused there is the bot's attempt 3, which takes Blacksmith.
The `persistent` output tells ci.yml to publish the marker the rescue
watcher looks for.

Main's full suite: ci-main-full-suite.yml dispatches ci.yml on main about
32 times a day, each a full suite (compile admission, 7 app-host shards,
tests-build-and-lag, cli-product-tests). That is main's own code, so it may
take an owned pool like a same-repository pull request, and ci-macos.yml
already routes a `workflow_dispatch` on `refs/heads/main` through the same
inputs. It is placed like a pull request, split and queue rounds
(CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS) included, on the owned pools only. With the
split and queue rounds, an owned pool with machines and root runners for
its whole run holds all of it (queued there), not just the jobs that fit:
the rest would take retry_runner and wait behind every overflowed pull
request. A smaller pool (light) still splits, since the excess would wait
past the owned-pool rescue's budget. With no owned pool it keeps its own route
(MACOS_RUNNER_PR), since only an owned pool is a candidate for it. With no Blacksmith pool to compare against, its jobs may
wait up to the queue rounds and the bound (owned_room()). Its side lanes (the
Claude wrapper, the remote daemon and the
universal Release build) are in its plan like a pull request's, and read the
pick through the same inputs. Main's CI concurrency group holds one run at a time, so main holds at most
one run's machines. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml watches it like a pull request.

Anything uncertain keeps today's route: an event other than pull_request or
main's dispatch, a
lane (MACOS_RUNNER_PR) naming another pool or unset (the documented way back
to the macOS 15 lane), an API error, a missing, stale or malformed snapshot,
or an invalid setting. The script then prints an empty runner, and every
job's own expression resolves exactly as before.

    than machines (choose()). A
    replayed run counts REPLAYED_RUN_JOBS on an owned pool and one on its
    root runners and on Blacksmith. `compared_jobs` (default `jobs`) is how
    many jobs Blacksmith's wait (reported, not compared) is read at: a
    replayed run takes the pool with one job but has REPLAYED_RUN_JOBS at once.

    first Blacksmith pool with a free machine (or at most max_queued
    queued), else the shortest queue in rounds.

    An owned pool fits while it holds all `jobs` (and, with a root count,
    `root_jobs` on its root runners). With `split`, when none does, the owned
    pool with the most room holds what fits (place()). An owned pool is never

    their markers (their peaks), and `ephemeral_since` counts runs whose pick
    finished off the owned pools; those are replayed over the Blacksmith
    pools only.
    `split` lets this run take part of an owned pool (pick(), place()).
    `root_jobs` is this run's peak on root runners, which an owned pool with
    a root count must have free too. Its root runners are charged one per
    replayed run (its admission), and `root_since` (`root_now` now) for the
