# Compiles the app-host test product with Xcode's compilation cache on for
# every target except cmuxTests, and except the app before Xcode 26.6 (see
# build()). cmuxTests also emits no Swift module. Owned minis add the deployed
# fleet-cas node's remote settings; other runners use the local CAS path and
# the scheduled seed writer. A cache entry is keyed on the whole compiler
# invocation and on absolute paths, so both jobs must build through this
# script or they stop sharing hits without anything failing.
#
# `fingerprint` keys the cache. A cache entry bakes in the absolute source and
# derived-data paths, so which paths the build used decides whether a seed can
# hit at all. Runner pools disagree about those paths -- Blacksmith checks out
# under /Users/runner/_work, WarpBuild under /Users/runner/work -- so a seed
# built on one pool could never hit on another.
#
# scripts/ci/canonical-build-root.sh removes that disagreement by building from
# a stable per-runner location every job on that runner can reproduce. A
# self-hosted runner derives its root from RUNNER_NAME, so another runner on
# the same Mac cannot remove its source tree or DerivedData. The root is part
# of the fingerprint when it is not the historical default, so a build never
# adopts a cache whose absolute paths belong to another runner.

# The resolve and every build run xcodebuild through

# the manifests the resolve (or the restored seed cache) evaluated instead of
# evaluating all 91 again, which took 18 to 44 s per admission.
#
# `build` disables package resolution, so a resolve that reports success
# without the Sparkle and Sentry binary artifacts would fail it. A restored
# source-packages cache can do that, and a failed resolve can leave a partial
# clone behind, so every retry starts from an empty package directory.

# `spm-` key for this Package.resolved. That cache was saved after a resolve of
# the same pins, so its repositories already hold every pinned revision; try
# once without fetching each package remote. Pins are exact revisions, so
# skipping the fetch cannot change what is checked out. If it fails for any
# reason, fall through to the normal resolve of the same cache.
#
# An owned Mac hands the resolve the packages its last job resolved
# (owned_build_state.py), which is no `spm-` hit at all, so every owned
# admission fetched all 11 package remotes: 10 to 55 s of the resolve,
# depending on GitHub (hq#661). A successful resolve therefore stamps the
# packages with the Package.resolved (and cache layout) it resolved. When the
# stamp matches this checkout, the packages are exactly what an exact `spm-`
# hit holds and take the same offline resolve and fallback.
