# Compiles the app-host test product with Xcode's compilation cache on. ci.yml
# `macos-compile-admission` restores that cache read-only and nightly.yml
# `refresh-test-compilation-cache` writes it. A cache entry is keyed on the
# whole compiler invocation and on absolute paths, so both jobs must build
# through this script or they stop sharing hits without anything failing.
#
# `fingerprint` keys the cache. A cache entry bakes in the absolute source and
# derived-data paths, so which paths the build used decides whether a seed can
# hit at all. Runner pools disagree about those paths -- Blacksmith checks out
# under /Users/runner/_work, WarpBuild under /Users/runner/work -- so a seed
# built on one pool could never hit on another.
#
# scripts/ci/canonical-build-root.sh removes that disagreement by building from
# a fixed location every pool can reproduce. When the build runs there the key
# drops the paths, because they are now a constant, and one seed serves every
# pool. A build anywhere else keeps the old path-scoped key and its own private
# cache, so an unconverted lane degrades to a miss rather than downloading a
# seed whose entries cannot hit.
