"""Which cmuxTests/ suites can observe a diff to app code. Report only.

test_impact.py walks a cmuxTests/ diff forward to the suites it edits. A pull
request that changes only Sources/ selects nothing there, so today it runs no
app-host behavior test at all. This walks the other way: each changed app
declaration is named, the name is searched for in cmuxTests/, a referencing
line inside a helper continues the trail through the helper's own name (as in
test_impact.py), and a referencing line inside a suite selects that suite.

Tests that drive the CLI binary or the socket never name the Swift code they
exercise; they assert on its text. So a string literal the diff adds or
removes, in app code or in CLI/, is searched for too, and a suite that spells
it out is selected the same way.

A name that says nothing specific is dropped rather than followed: Swift and
Foundation vocabulary (`init`, `name`, `update`), a name more than HOT_TEST_FILES
test files mention, or a name several app files declare that the test does not
qualify by its owner type. The report records each one and why.

The selection is costed from the measured timings choose_ci_suite.py already
uses, compared with CHANGED_SUITES_BUDGET_MS, and when it does not fit, the
most specific names are kept greedily until the budget is spent.

Nothing reads this report to route a run. ci.yml records it in the step
summary and as an artifact, so its recall can be measured against the suites
that later fail on main before anything depends on it.
