"""Let pull-request compile admission build incrementally from the nightly seed.

    seed_derived_data.py record SOURCE DERIVED_DATA
    seed_derived_data.py prune DERIVED_DATA
    seed_derived_data.py start DERIVED_DATA PREFIX REVISION
    seed_derived_data.py adopt SOURCE DERIVED_DATA PREFIX REVISION
    seed_derived_data.py scope PREFIX
    seed_derived_data.py prefetch STORE REVISION
    seed_derived_data.py keep DERIVED_DATA KEY [PREFIX]

nightly.yml `refresh-test-compilation-cache` (scheduled while CI_PR_POOL_OWNED
is not 1, or a seed_only dispatch) compiles main cold on the
runner, Xcode and canonical paths that ci-macos.yml compile admission uses.
`record` writes the content digest and modification time of every file in the
canonical source tree into that DerivedData before the build, and `prune`
drops the parts no later build reads, so the seeder can save it to R2.

A fresh checkout stamps every file with the checkout time, so a restored
DerivedData alone rebuilds everything. `adopt` restores the newest seed into a
staging directory, swaps it in only when it is complete, and then restores the
recorded time onto every byte-identical input. Changed and new inputs get the
current time, so Xcode rebuilds exactly what differs. A seed from an older main
costs compile time, never correctness.

That time is mostly distance, not the diff under test: a CmuxFoundation change
between the seed and the checkout recompiles every file of the `cmux` module.
So `adopt` takes the seed of REVISION, the commit being built on, or else of
its nearest ancestor that has one. It used to take the pull request event's
base.sha, which is not always the merge commit's parent, and then the newest
pointer, which records the last save rather than the latest commit: nightly's
cold seed of an older main held it while newer seeds sat unused. Every miss
or failure leaves the DerivedData the caller had, which is today's cold build.

`start` picks that seed and begins its download in a detached process, so it
overlaps the package resolve that must finish before `adopt` can replay input
times. `adopt` with the same PREFIX and REVISION reuses the pick and waits for
the download instead of downloading again; without a matching `start` it picks
and downloads itself.

A seed also serves only the machine width it was built at. Swift Build
passes the runner's CPU count to every swift-driver invocation as -j<n>, so
a seed built on 12 vCPU reran all 94 SwiftDriver tasks and re-emitted 62
modules on a 6 vCPU admission at seed distance 0 (run 36043267820). Keys
therefore carry the width, `<PREFIX>j<n>-<revision>`: `scope` prints the
prefix a saver writes under, and `start` and `adopt` take the unscoped
PREFIX, prefer their own width, and fall back to another width's seed,
which still beats a cold build.

An owned Mac downloads a seed at about a third of Blacksmith's speed (about
190 s against 64 s on 2026-09-25). With CMUX_SEED_LOCAL_CACHE set, `adopt`
clones the seed it just restored into that directory, keeping as many as the
disk holds (prune_local), and `start` and `adopt` clone an exact key from there instead of
downloading it. A clone shares blocks on APFS, so it costs seconds.
owned_build_state.py `prefer` reads the same cache. The cache is this Mac's
own state, like its kept DerivedData: nothing in it is uploaded.

A job's own download still costs it those 190 s whenever the Mac has not seen
the seed yet, and the newest seed moves with every main push. So an idle
owned Mac fetches ahead: `prefetch` reads the seed prefix the last owned job
on that root recorded (SEED_SOURCE in STORE, written by owned_build_state.py
`check`), finds REVISION's nearest seed of this width, and downloads it into
STORE/seeds when it is not there yet. It runs outside any job, from glaeda on
the Mac, with no credentials: the bucket is publicly readable, and REVISION's
history comes from a local git directory (CMUX_SEED_GIT_DIR) instead of the
GitHub API. Nothing a job is cloning is pruned under it: `adopt` touches the
seed before cloning, and the prune spares seeds touched in the last
PRUNE_GRACE_SECONDS.

Only jobs holding the bucket credentials can write R2 objects or pointers, and
only the main-branch seeder is given them, so a pull request can read the seed
but never replace it.
