"""Select the full macOS suite policy or the reduced PR suite policy.

The full policy permits expensive app-host shards, package tests, lag builds,
and Release lanes, subject to each lane's path routing and dependencies.
The reduced policy still runs compile admission and independently routed tests;
it is not a request to skip all tests. `full-ci` explicitly opts into the broad
policy, not normal PR validation or a generic review/merge prerequisite. Choose
coverage appropriate to the change and verify which tests actually executed.

The answer is "full" unless everything says otherwise: only a pull_request
event, under the compile-only policy, without the opt-in label, gets less.

Compile admission cannot judge a change to the test suite itself: the tests
compile and are then not run. The policy's own justification is that "with a
merge queue the full suite runs on the commit that will land", so a pull
request that edits the app-host tests and skips the suite is only safe while
that queue is in the path. This module also reports whether the diff is one
that compile admission cannot judge, so CI can refuse to call such a run
green by default rather than silently skipping the only check that applies.
