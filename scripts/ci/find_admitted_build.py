"""Find an earlier run of this pull request that compiled the same build inputs.

Every pull request run attempt publishes an artifact named after its
build-input fingerprint and its attempt number. A later run with the same
fingerprint has nothing new to compile, so it may skip compile admission if an
earlier run passed it in the same attempt that published that fingerprint. A
rerun can fingerprint different inputs (the selected Xcode is a repository
variable), so a pass from one attempt says nothing about another's fingerprint.
Only runs from this repository's own branches count: a fork's run can rewrite
its workflow and report anything. Any API error means "not found".
