"""Decide whether a pull request needs the full web complexity scan.

The required `Web complexity` check re-lints the entire production web tree on
every pull request, including ones that touch no web code at all. The policy it
enforces is incremental: findings are grandfathered into
`web/oxlint-complexity-baseline.txt` and that baseline may only shrink. So when
a pull request changes no production web source and no complexity policy,
toolchain, or baseline file, the scan's result cannot differ from the trusted
base it is compared against, and running it is pure cost.

This module answers exactly that question and nothing else. It never decides to
skip when it is unsure: an unreadable, truncated, or unexpected input list
returns "scan".

Security note: the paths handed to this module are candidate-controlled data.
They arrive from the GitHub pull-request files API, not from the candidate tree,
and are only ever compared as strings. Nothing here reads, executes, or resolves
a candidate path on disk.
