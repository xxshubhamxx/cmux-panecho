# Run "$@" inside the logged-in console user's Aqua (GUI) login session.
#
# Why: `xcodebuild test` needs testmanagerd's control service, which only exists
# in the console user's GUI login-session bootstrap namespace. On a self-hosted
# Mac whose runner agent is NOT itself in that session (e.g. a root/daemon
# context), the test command runs in the wrong bootstrap, can't find
# com.apple.testmanagerd.control ("No such process"), and times out initiating
# the control session, so 0 tests run. Hopping into the console user's session
# (launchctl asuser) puts the command in the right bootstrap.
#
# Safe by construction:
#   - If no real console user is logged in (console owner is root/loginwindow),
#     or passwordless sudo is unavailable, it falls back to running in the
#     current bootstrap. That is exactly today's behavior, so it can never make
#     a runner worse; it only helps runners that DO have a logged-in user the
#     command was failing to reach.
#   - On a runner whose agent is already in the console session, the hop is into
#     the same session (effectively a no-op).
#
# This mirrors the proven elevation used by perf-activation.yml and the
# automation-mode setup used by the ui-regressions job.
