"""Pick the macOS pool an E2E run lands on.

test-e2e.yml and scripts/ci/dispatch-focused-test.py both call this, so a
workflow started from the Actions UI, `gh workflow run`, or run-e2e.sh applies
one rule.

`runner: auto` means `vars.MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` when it names a pool, else the
6vcpu macOS 26 pool. On that default an E2E run takes a pool by the rule pull
request CI uses (pr_runner_pool.py, whose decide() this calls), limited to the
macOS 26 pools:

    order     vars.CI_PR_POOL_ORDER without its macOS 15 pool; by default
                blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26, then blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
    headroom  a machine free on that label's Blacksmith plan capacity, or at most
              vars.CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED jobs queued (default 0), and no
              queued release or nightly job on the pool

When neither pool has headroom the run takes the shorter queue in rounds.
Every Blacksmith pool is sponsored, so cost is not a reason to hold the
12vcpu pool back: a release or nightly job actually queued on it is the only
thing that keeps E2E off it (release and nightly builds must not wait behind
E2E). E2E never goes to macOS 15, whose Xcode and app-host tests differ from
the macOS 26 lane E2E answers for.

The queue comes from the queue janitor's `macos-pool-load` snapshot, the one
pull request CI reads (only a copy uploaded by a run on main counts). Runs
created since the snapshot are replayed before choosing, one job each:
in-flight E2E runs on the pool their title names ("<filter> on <runner> @
<ref>"), and in-flight pull request CI runs through the pull request rule
over its whole order (or on their lane, when the snapshot's copied settings
show pull request routing off). The replay treats macOS 15 as usable without
checking its Xcode pin, so it can lean slightly toward macOS 26 headroom. A 6vcpu `auto` run started from the Actions UI is
titled with the default (run-name cannot read job outputs), so it counts
there wherever it landed; run-e2e.sh names its pool, so its titles are exact.

API budget: at most four requests per decision, never retried or polled (the
artifact listing, its download, and one page each of E2E and pull request CI
runs since the snapshot), plus one for the pull request runs of the live
window when the runners are read live (below). The GITHUB_TOKEN allows about 1000 requests an hour
for the whole repository, so listing jobs here is out of reach.

Anything uncertain stays on the 6vcpu default: an API error, a missing, stale
or malformed snapshot, an order with no macOS 26 pool, or an invalid setting.
`vars.CI_E2E_LARGE_POOL_OVERFLOW == '0'` turns the choice off without reading
the queue. An explicit runner, or a variable naming any other pool, is never
rerouted.

Owned Macs (glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>, pr_runner_pool.persistent) join
the choice exactly as they do for pull requests: only when
`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED == '1'`, only the labels for the lane's Xcode pin
(vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR), ahead of Blacksmith, on a snapshot younger than
pr_runner_pool.MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES, and by pull request CI's queue rule
(vars.CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS, `--queue-rounds`): an owned pool takes the run
while its job starts there within that many job lengths, whatever
Blacksmith's wait, and the queue stays within machines x (1 + rounds)
(pr_runner_pool.owned_room()). Without the rounds the picker used the kill
switch rule, which counts every in-flight run's whole future peak (the
janitor's `committed`) as taken now: on 2026-09-25 that read 43 of 32 std
machines taken while 8 ran (run 36136190497, an iOS run on this rule).
`--queue-rounds 0` restores it; a caller that omits the flag gets it too.
The rounds decide only whether an owned pool takes the run: when none does,
the Blacksmith pool is chosen by the headroom rule above, as before.
ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml gives a test-e2e.yml run's owned jobs the same
queue allowance as a CI run's before it moves them. An E2E run holds one machine at a time
(build, then test), so it needs one free machine. glaeda gives both jobs the
mini's canonical-root token, so when CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS gives the pool a root
count (pr_runner_pool.root_label()) the run takes the root label and needs a
free root runner as well. An owned pool is never the
fewest-queued fallback: with no room within the rounds the run takes Blacksmith. A job
that waits on, or is refused by, an owned Mac is re-run by
ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml. A re-run that keeps attempt 1's pick, and every
attempt from 3 on, takes retry_runner(); a full re-run's attempt 2 takes its
own new pick (test-e2e.yml's `picked_attempt`). That holds for an explicit
owned runner too.

Live owned capacity: with the org App's token (ROUTE_TOKEN; test-e2e.yml mints
it for this repository's runs while owned pools are on), the owned pools are
counted from the runners API as pull request CI counts them
(pr_runner_pool.live_owned_free, live_online and live_pools): idle runners
carrying the label are its free machines, and the online ones its capacity.
An App without the organization runners permission gets a repository-only
token (test-e2e.yml's second mint), as pull request CI does. Only the pull request runs of the last
pr_runner_pool.LIVE_WINDOW_MINUTES are charged to the owned pools, since an
older run's jobs are already on runners and show busy there; the rest of the
snapshot window counts on the Blacksmith pools only. Every in-flight E2E run
naming an owned pool is still charged there: one can wait in its `sibling`
job for a same-commit compile for up to 30 minutes holding no Mac yet, so the
runners API cannot see it. That errs high by the few E2E runs already
running. Without the token, or on any error listing runners, the snapshot decides as before. The listing uses
the App's own request budget, not the GITHUB_TOKEN's.
An `auto` run started from the Actions UI is titled with the 6vcpu default,
so the replay counts it there even when it took an owned Mac; run-e2e.sh
names the pool it chose, so its runs are counted where they are.

Only cmuxTests runs go to an owned Mac on `auto` for now: UI tests need
Automation Mode enabled without authentication, which takes an admin on
each Mac (`sudo automationmodetool enable-automationmode-without-authentication`)
and the job's runner user cannot do it. Once the fleet has it,
`vars.CI_E2E_OWNED_UI == '1'` lets UI runs take owned Macs too.

Blacksmith's macOS sessions sit at a locked screen, so no app comes to the
front and every UI test fails after a minute ("Failed to activate
application"; runs 36311300649, 36314786865 and 36315094804 on 2026-09-27,
while the same tests passed on owned Macs). So an unpinned UI run that may
take an owned Mac never ends on Blacksmith while an owned pool has machines
(ui_owned_runner(), applied last wherever a UI run's pool is chosen: here
and in dispatch-focused-test.py): with no owned room it queues on the owned
pool, whatever the rule above or its fallbacks picked, and a re-run of it
stays there too (retry_runner()). That overrides "an owned pool is never
the fewest-queued fallback" and the move to Blacksmith for re-runs, for UI
runs only. It overrides "an explicit runner is never rerouted" too, for the
Blacksmith macOS 26 and macos-latest pools only (BLACKSMITH_NO_UI): their
sessions cannot capture the screen either, so a recorded UI run pinned there
fails in its capture preflight before any test runs (every one of 21 such runs
between 2026-09-27 and 2026-09-28, 2 of them on macos-latest, e.g. run
36426283823). A pinned macOS 15 run, an owned label, or a fleet the rule above
leaves alone keeps its pin. A moved run keeps its pinned title, so the replay
charges it to the Blacksmith pool it names, as for a moved `auto` run.
