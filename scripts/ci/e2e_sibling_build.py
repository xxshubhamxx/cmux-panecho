"""Wait for an earlier test-e2e.yml run that is compiling the same revision.

Dispatches of one commit with different selectors fall in different
concurrency groups, so each compiled the same product. Of the 25 dispatches
between 2026-09-23 and 2026-09-24 that repeated a commit and pool, at least 12
compiled while an identical compile was still running in an earlier run.

`wait` runs in test-e2e.yml's Linux `sibling` job, before the build job asks
for a macOS runner. It finds the oldest unfinished earlier dispatch of this
revision on the same macOS and polls that run's build job. Exit status 0 means
the job published its product, so the build job's reuse step restores it; 1
means there is nothing to wait for, the other compile failed, or the budget ran
out, and the build job compiles as before.

A run waits only on a run whose current attempt started before its own
(run_started_at, then id), so two runs never wait on each other. The id alone
is not that order: a full re-run keeps its id but starts again, after runs
with higher ids may have begun compiling. A run re-run while another waits on
it has started after the waiter, so the waiter stops and compiles.

A re-run of failed jobs, as the owned-pool rescue does, does not re-run this
job, so that attempt never waits. Run 36168890047's attempt 2 compiled product
8c48a10e of 4f0ac55 at 17:47Z beside run 36168944875 that way.
