"""Warm-state distance: what a compile admission starts from, what it costs, and a model to route by.

    warm_distance.py collect HOST...            every mini's admissions.jsonl, over SSH, to stdout

An owned mini keeps compile admission's DerivedData (owned_build_state.py),
and what a compile costs depends on how far its start (the kept build, or a
seed) is from the tree it builds. Measured on 142 owned admissions on
2026-09-25 (cmuxterm-hq#661 WS6): starting within 5 app Swift files of the
build never recompiled the `cmux` module (0 of 21), 6 or more did in 26 of
40, and so did any change to an imported package's interface (about 2,700
`cmux` files) and to in-module types most files use (AppDelegate,
Workspace, cmuxApp). Commit counts and the kept record's changed inputs
predicted it badly. An avoided rebuild saves about 220 s of wall time.

Distance is counted in app Swift files: changed `.swift` files outside
tests (any `/Tests/`, cmuxTests/, cmuxUITests/). A package Swift file is one
under PACKAGE_SOURCES; a package change is an interface change when a changed
line declares something `public`, `open` or `package`, or `@inlinable` /
`@usableFromInline` code, which every importer sees. A hot file is one the
model lists (HOT_FILES, refit from the data).

Record. owned_build_state.py `record` compares the digests of the tree it is
about to compile with the record the adopted DerivedData carries (the kept
build's own record, or the seed's manifest) and writes the changed paths to
CMUX_WARM_DISTANCE_START: the exact distance, at no cost, since the record is
computed anyway. `admission` runs at the end of every owned admission and
appends one JSON line to STORE/admissions.jsonl with the pull request, head,
merge base, the start (kept build, seed or cold), the distance features, the
SwiftCompile units per target from the build log, whether the `cmux` module
was rebuilt (APP_REBUILD_UNITS or more units), compile, admission and queue
seconds, the runner and root, and the routing decisions (the picker's pin and
glaeda's root choice). It also stamps the kept build with this pull
request's own app Swift files, which glaeda's hook needs to tell how far that
build is from the next job, and copies the model next to the stamps for the
hook. Everything is best effort and bounded: it never fails the job.

Model. `fit` reads admission lines (these, or the backfill of 09-25/26 job
logs) and fits tiers, each a p50/p90 compile time:

- near: at most NEAR_APP_SWIFT_FILES app Swift files, no package interface
  change, no hot file;
- far: more files, or a hot file, no package interface change;
- package: a package interface change (unknown counts as one).

It also fits the start classes the picker can see before the job starts
(start_classes: a kept build of the same merge base, of the same pull
request, or anything else, by the pull request's own tier) and job lengths
per glaeda job class (job_seconds) for the picker's wait estimate, and each
tier's p50 per start kind (tiers_by_start, with counts): a near compile from
a kept build costs about 90 s, one from a seed about 155 s. predict() uses a
start's cell once it has MIN_START_ROWS compiles, else the tier, and so does
glaeda's hook for a root's kept build. `refit` refits only the tiers and
cells from recent admissions, `backtest` replays them in time order, and
warm_model_refit.py runs both daily and proposes a drifted model as a pull
request. The model is scripts/ci/warm-distance-model.json; refit all of it with

    python3 scripts/ci/warm_distance.py collect cmux14 cmux8s-mac-mini ... > data.jsonl
    python3 scripts/ci/warm_distance.py fit data.jsonl --out scripts/ci/warm-distance-model.json

    busy, and on a slower mini. A busy runner adds its expected wait (one the

    whichever idle root runner GitHub picks: the mean of their costs, or,
