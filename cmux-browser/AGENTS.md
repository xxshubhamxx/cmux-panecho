# cmux Browser contributor notes

The Chromium-based cmux Browser product: a source overlay and build harness, not a Chromium checkout. Never vendor Chromium, generated build output, signed applications, update keys, or private builder configuration here.

## Repository boundaries

- Resolve the cmux TUI backend from `../cmux-tui` and Ghostty from the repository's `../ghostty` gitlink.
- Keep Chromium overlay paths under `overlay/` identical to their destination paths in a Chromium source tree.
- Derive paths from the monorepo and Browser roots. No developer home directories, private hostnames, tailnet addresses, or volume paths.
- Pin Chromium with a full commit ID and preserve enough build metadata to reproduce every distributed binary.

## Licensing and provenance

Every imported or new source file has a recorded provenance and license. Do not apply the repository's default license over third-party material.

- Manaflow rights-controlled files use GPL-3.0-or-later. Commercial terms may be offered separately only for portions whose necessary rights Manaflow controls; authorship alone is not proof of that control.
- Chromium-derived files retain Chromium's BSD-3-Clause notice.
- Helium-derived files retain GPL-3.0-only provenance and the exact source revision. Helium-derived code is not available under Manaflow's commercial license.
- Other bundled dependencies retain their own terms and must appear in the generated notices and corresponding-source manifest.

When changing a shipped dependency, update its exact revision or digest, source URL, license text, and source-offer record in the same change. A build must fail closed if any shipped file has no license mapping.

Do not add a nested copy of the root `LICENSE`; it could be read as licensing third-party or mixed-origin files commercially. Use per-file notices, exact provenance, and a generated release composition manifest.

## Validation

Run the fast host, patch-fixture, script, and protocol tests before review. Release candidates additionally require a full Chromium build, generated Chromium third-party notices, bundle-license verification, and the macOS XCUITest terminal-render suite against the exact packaged cmux and Ghostty revisions.

Never run untrusted pull-request code on a self-hosted builder with private network access or signing credentials.
