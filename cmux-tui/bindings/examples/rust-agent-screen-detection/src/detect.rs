//! Screen-derived agent lifecycle detection.
//!
//! Detection semantics derived from herdr (https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr),
//! Apache-2.0, commit `7b675f42af35508eab66ac42fe1598628597a893`, especially
//! `src/detect/mod.rs` and `src/pane/agent_detection.rs`, modified by
//! manaflow. First-acquisition OSC retention follows herdr commit
//! `82e6a80eb3ae39fb3d3ebd4d1fed19389767e605` (`src/pane.rs`), adapted here
//! as a local metadata fence because the generic host API does not let a
//! plugin clear terminal OSC state.
//!
//! The plugin watches every PTY's output stream; when a terminal goes quiet
//! (debounced), the foreground process name selects a herdr-derived manifest
//! and the terminal tail is evaluated against it. State transitions, never
//! per-scan states, append namespaced `agent.*` journal events, so the
//! journal-derived roster covers agents that expose no hooks. The engine port
//! lives in [`manifest`]; this module owns pure edge-trigger bookkeeping.
