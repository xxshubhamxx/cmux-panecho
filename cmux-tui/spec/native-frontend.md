# Native Frontend Ownership

This document owns cmux-tui behavior that belongs to one interactive frontend
rather than the shared mux. It prevents local UI state, host terminal side
channels, and filesystem access from being mistaken for portable control
protocol features.

## Entrypoints

The configurable `Action` and context-menu `MenuAction` enums are exhaustively
classified in [`inventory.json`](inventory.json). CI rejects an added variant
without a route. Actions may call a mux command, compose snapshot or geometry
state with a command, invoke the separate machine-provider protocol, or remain
frontend-only.

Direct pointer routing, omnibar hits, drag state, selection, and file-sidebar
navigation do not all have enum variants. They remain frontend-owned unless a
shared command in [`commands.md`](commands.md) explicitly takes authority.
Remote automation of frontend-owned behavior uses the proposed adapter in
[`programmability.md`](programmability.md#frontend-action-adapter).

The native TUI keeps active workspace, screen, pane, tab, text selection, and
scroll state in its `App` instance. Tree refreshes preserve those choices by
stable resource identity. They never write the mux's shared active fields.
Even when the TUI starts the server itself, it reconnects through the normal
remote-session path so each terminal view has its own VT mirror and viewport.
Selecting a visible terminal view explicitly transfers canonical geometry to
that client/view pair.

## Persistent Swift frontend boundary

The persistent daemon has three identity lifetimes that must remain separate:

- a durable resource address is `(machine_id, session_id, resource_id)`;
  hostname, socket, relay, and mount route are mutable resolution data;
- a durable frontend view is `(frontend_id, window_id)`, represented by one
  `frontend_projection` public ID and fenced by a new generation on relaunch;
- a live attachment is one connection-local stream and opaque view lease. It
  owns transient render delivery and may temporarily participate in canonical
  terminal sizing.

The current multiview path already keeps the PTY and terminal content under the
session while giving each attachment a private VT mirror. The remaining legacy
paths are the compatibility active workspace, screen, and pane fields, opaque
frontend projections with no typed owner, and resource viewer controls that
identify only a connection. Those paths cannot identify two Swift windows
multiplexed over one socket.

Two designs were considered. Connection-owned projections are smaller, but
they cannot survive reconnect, distinguish windows, or support following one
frontend view. Stable window projections plus expiring attachment leases add
one explicit identity layer and preserve those properties. The stable-window
design is the frontend contract.

Shared topology must not gain a globally active resource. A frontend restores
its durable window projection, resolves each durable resource address through
the current route table, and attaches to resources that are still live. Cold
journal reduction is a separate fallback that reconstructs historical state;
it never pretends to reattach a dead process. A terminal checkpoint restores
renderable terminal state, not arbitrary child-process memory.

Live following uses an ephemeral presence stream keyed by frontend projection
and generation. Discrete settled focus changes may also update the durable
projection and journal. Continuous scroll and animation samples stay on the
presence stream, with only settled state checkpointed, so following does not
wait for durable storage or turn paint-rate data into restoration history.

Remote creation is a durable operation, not a cross-machine transaction. The
origin daemon records a caller-generated correlation key and the states
`prepared`, `executing`, `created`, `not_applied`, or `indeterminate`. Swift may
render a projection-local placeholder keyed by that correlation key, then
replace it with the authoritative resource address or an explicit failure.
Routes never become resource identity, and disconnect never implies failure.

View-size leases are live presence. They are removed when their stream or
connection closes and remote mounts must additionally expire them when their
heartbeat generation is lost. Durable frontend geometry is only a restoration
preference; it does not keep a stale canonical PTY-size claim alive.

## Startup workspace mutation

The native TUI prepares visible topology before entering terminal mode. When
machine-provider state does not suppress initialization, a local in-process
session calls `new-workspace` on every native startup, even when restored
workspaces already exist. An attached remote session instead refreshes the
tree and calls `new-workspace` only when the session has no workspaces.

The initial cell size is the first pane's computed content rectangle after
sidebar and border layout; unavailable terminal geometry falls back to normal
mux sizing. A spawn failure aborts startup before terminal mode.

Machine-provider state can suppress this mutation. The native TUI creates
nothing when the selected machine session is unavailable or its workspace
creation policy is provider-owned. For other available machine sessions, the
local-versus-remote rules above apply. A replacement frontend that intends to
match native startup must reproduce this decision before rendering; merely
connecting is not read-only under the local native path.

## Configuration

The current key and default contract is [`docs/configuration.md`](../docs/configuration.md).
Resolution is `CMUX_TUI_CONFIG`, legacy `CMUX_MUX_CONFIG`, then
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmux/cmux-tui.json` or `~/.config/cmux/cmux-tui.json`, with
legacy `mux.json` only when the preferred file is absent.

Typed sections reject unknown fields. A parse failure logs an error and loads
defaults rather than partially applying the document. The built-in sidebar
default is `workspaces`. `theme.chrome` accepts `auto`, `light`, or `dark`.
`reload-config` requests a frontend reload; it is not a transactional config
write and does not prove every runtime resource was restarted.

Current keymap grammar, default bindings, replacement rules, and prefix
behavior are local configuration. A portable config API requires the
versioned schema, ownership, validation, patch, and change-event contract in
`programmability.md`.

## Host terminal side channels

The native TUI may:

- query OSC 10 and OSC 11 briefly at startup and use the replies as color
  defaults;
- write OSC 52 to copy a local selection;
- write OSC 22 pointer-shape updates over clickable UI;
- use Kitty graphics and keyboard capabilities;
- probe terminal pixel geometry and fall back to an implementation default.

These are capabilities of the outer terminal, not mux state. They have no
delivery acknowledgement in protocol v9. A remote render client must negotiate
and implement its own host capabilities; it must not infer support from
`identify.protocol`.

Selection coordinates, hover, pressed pointer targets, omnibar text, menus,
sidebar focus, rail widths, and a remote frontend's scroll position are
frontend-local. The mux exposes terminal text and shared topology, not those
ephemeral interaction states.

## Filesystem and process launch

The built-in file sidebar reads the TUI host filesystem directly and may open a
file through `$EDITOR`, change a terminal directory, or create a browser file
URL. It is available only when the frontend can access the same filesystem.
A browser or remote frontend needs the separately permissioned filesystem
capability proposed in `programmability.md`; mux control authority alone does
not grant file access.

## Localization

The native catalog currently contains English and Japanese strings for
pairing, foreign viewport hints, and machine/sidebar flows. Locale precedence
is `LC_ALL`, then `LC_MESSAGES`, then `LANG`; values beginning with `ja`
select Japanese and every other value selects English.

The catalog does not yet cover every native label. Frontend SDKs receive
semantic state and error codes where available; they do not receive prelocalized
UI prose. Portable frontend localization requires stable message keys and
catalog completeness checks.

## Diagnostics and sensitive data

Status events are transient presentation messages. Subprocess diagnostics have
component-specific byte bounds and redaction, so they are not a stable logging
API.

`CMUX_MUX_DEBUG_MIRROR_DUMP` is a local diagnostic switch. When set, a remote
TUI retains frame logs and writes terminal mirror contents on drop to the named
directory. Those files can contain terminal secrets. Tooling must treat the
directory as sensitive, opt-in storage and must not enable it for ordinary
sessions.
