# SDK contract

cmux ships handwritten resource APIs for Rust, Python, TypeScript, Go, Java,
C++20, and Zig. Each package also contains a generated private-protocol layer
under an explicit `raw` namespace.

The split is deliberate:

- [`resource-operations-v2.json`](resource-operations-v2.json) defines the
  stable public operations, selectors, fields, results, errors, and streams.
- Public resource handles, options, lifecycle, errors, and conveniences are
  handwritten in each language.
- Mechanical protocol-v12 models are generated deterministically and exposed
  only through `raw`.
- A catalog descriptor in every package proves that all 125 transported
  operations have the same class and wire name.
- The six sidebar plugin operations are local CLI/filesystem APIs. Transported
  SDK roots expose sidebar views, not plugin resource handles. Agent plugin
  install, selection, update, and removal are also CLI-only because they build
  and replace caller-owned executables; they are specified in `plugins.md`, not
  as transport operations.

Code generation is a repository build tool. It is never a consumer dependency
and does not define the public API.

## Shared behavior

Every high-level SDK must provide:

| Area | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| IDs | Distinct typed wrappers for every opaque resource prefix; no numeric or abbreviated forms |
| Selectors | ID, `current`, or exact name; name lookup returns all matches |
| Handles | Machine, session, workspace, screen, pane, tab, terminal, browser, and auxiliary resource handles |
| Routing | Session resources always carry machine and session selectors; direct opaque targets require no hidden lookup |
| Names | Exact bytes, including empty, whitespace, and Unicode; duplicate names stay ambiguous |
| Commands | Exact argument arrays, target-platform shell scripts, and explicitly selected shell executables |
| Mutations | Secure 128-bit default idempotency keys; explicit keys use 1 to 128 UTF-8 bytes, contain non-whitespace, and exclude Unicode control scalars; optional expected revision, one wire request, and no implicit retry |
| Results | Flat `value`, `generation`, decimal-string `revision`, and `replayed` fields |
| Errors | Transport, timeout, decode, and structured resource errors retain code, message, details, and retryability |
| Streams | Typed items, explicit cancellation, bounded unread queues, structured end state, and per-stream overflow isolation |
| Evolution | Unknown stream variants retain their discriminator and complete raw object; malformed known variants fail decoding |
| Secrets | Pairing codes and renderer tokens are redacted from formatting and errors |
| Raw access | Private protocol-v12 APIs are reachable only through a package path containing `raw` |

Decimal wire values remain strings. TypeScript never converts them to
`number`; Java uses `BigInteger`; other SDKs validate canonical unsigned
decimal text before an optional native conversion. Journal producer versions
are bounded positive uint32 values in every binding, and manifest size,
permission, subject, correlation, and sensitivity limits are checked before a
socket write. JSON Schema compilation and payload authorization remain server
responsibilities.

The server may return `mutation.indeterminate` after a crash around an external
effect. SDKs retain the structured error and never repeat that key
automatically.

## Commands

An exact command preserves every argument and does not invoke a shell:

```text
["printf", "%s\n", "$HOME"]
```

A shell command asks the server to use the target platform's default shell
with `-lc`. Choosing a specific executable sends the exact array:

```text
["/bin/zsh", "-lc", "printf ready"]
```

SDKs never read, expand, or transmit the caller's `$SHELL`.

## Streams

The public stream families are:

- session snapshots and atomic resource-change batches;
- styled terminal render snapshots, patches, and scroll state;
- browser state and frames;
- styled sidebar render snapshots, patches, and scroll state.

Each stream has a caller-generated typed ID. The server installs its event tap
before acknowledging the open request and releases the initial snapshot after
that response. Cancellation is connection-local. A queue holds at most 256
messages and 16 MiB. Overflow ends only that stream with a gap and recovery
cursor.

## Language mapping

| Language | Public style | Owned lifetime | Minimum | Runtime dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | `Result`, typed handles, blocking iterators | `Client` and stream objects | Rust 1.88 | `serde`, `serde_json`, `getrandom`, narrow Unix support |
| Python | typed classes and dataclasses, sync plus `asyncio` facade | context-managed clients and iterators | Python 3.9 | standard library |
| TypeScript | branded IDs, promises, discriminated unions, async iterables | client, stream, and `AbortSignal` | Node 20 or browser ESM | none |
| Go | generic typed selectors, `context.Context`, typed stream receivers | client, context, and stream cancellation | Go 1.22 | standard library |
| Java | immutable values, builders, `BigInteger`, synchronous streams | `AutoCloseable` client and streams | Java 17 | standard library |
| C++ | value types, `result<T>`, `std::variant`, move-only RAII streams | RAII client and streams | C++20, CMake 3.20 | standard library |
| Zig | typed IDs, error unions, explicit allocator-owned values | explicit `deinit` | Zig 0.15.2 | standard library |

### Rust

The `cmux-sdk` package exports crate `cmux`. Resource handles clone without
I/O. Mutation helpers create one secure key; `_with` variants accept explicit
mutation options. Typed streams are owned iterators with cancellation handles.
Journal producers use `Session::journal_producers`,
`Session::put_journal_producer`, and `Session::append_journal`; the types are
generic and do not require agent-specific core code. The longer
`put_journal_producer_manifest` and `append_journal_event` spellings remain
source-compatible aliases.
The optional `cmux-sidebar` package applies terminal-style render patches to a
Ratatui buffer and forwards typed input without adding Ratatui to the base SDK.
Private models live under `cmux::raw`.

### Python

`cmux.Client` is synchronous and supports `with`. `cmux.aio.Client` mirrors the
resource graph for `asyncio`. Cancellation closes its dedicated connection and
releases reader threads. The package supports Python 3.9 without runtime
dependencies. Private models live under `cmux.raw`.
Generic producers use `list_journal_producers`, `put_journal_producer`, and
`append_journal`; the longer `put_journal_producer_manifest` and
`append_journal_event` names remain compatibility aliases.

### TypeScript

The `cmux-sdk` package root exports the portable client. `cmux-sdk/browser` is
browser-safe ESM and accepts an injected WebSocket transport. `cmux-sdk/node`
adds Unix socket discovery. Shared modules import no Node built-ins.
Stream APIs are `AsyncIterable`, accept `AbortSignal`, and preserve decimal
strings. Private models live under `cmux-sdk/raw`.
Generic producers use `listJournalProducers`, `putJournalProducer`, and
`appendJournal`. The public model uses camelCase while the wire keeps the
schema's snake_case names.

### Go

Package `cmux` accepts `context.Context` on blocking operations. Context
cancellation stops local waiting and closes dedicated streams; it does not
claim to cancel an already executing mutation. A dial function can inject a
transport on Windows and in tests. Private models live under `cmux/raw`.
Generic producers use `ListJournalProducers`, `PutJournalProducer`, and
`AppendJournal`; the options and results use typed uint32 versions and owned
JSON payload values.

### Java

Package `com.cmux` uses builders for requests with several optional fields and
immutable results. `Client` and `ResourceStream` support
try-with-resources. A transport can be injected for WebSockets, non-Unix
platforms, and tests. Private models live under `com.cmux.raw`.
Generic producers use `journalProducers`, `putJournalProducer`, and
`appendJournal`. Java represents schema and manifest versions as `long` so the
full uint32 wire range is representable before validation.

### C++20

Headers under `cmux` expose native C++ value types and no Rust ABI.
`cmux::result<T>` separates typed failure categories. The default transport is
Unix JSON Lines; applications inject other transports. Private headers live
under `cmux/raw`.
Generic producers use `journal_producers`, `put_journal_producer`, and
`append_journal`. `class` and `namespace` stay available through the public
names `journal_class` and `namespace_` where the language reserves them.

### Zig

Public methods accept an explicit allocator for owned data. Results and streams
require `deinit`. Errors retain structured remote fields and secret values are
zeroized when their owning values are released. Private modules live under
`raw`.
Generic producers use `journalProducers`, `putJournalProducer`, and
`appendJournal`. Zig public fields use `journal_class` and `namespace_` for
the reserved wire names `class` and `namespace`; all returned values have an
explicit allocator owner and `deinit`.

## Transport parity

Unix sockets use one JSON object per line. WebSockets use one JSON object per
text frame. Both carry the same `cmux.protocol/2` envelopes and ordering.
Transport-specific code may frame and authenticate a connection; it may not
change operation parameters or results.

Public clients must bound:

- one request to 4 MiB;
- one response or stream envelope to 16 MiB;
- pending response routing;
- unread messages and bytes independently for each stream.

Closing a client unblocks pending reads and releases owned transports.

## Deterministic raw generation

The raw generator:

1. consumes the reviewed protocol-v12 schema;
2. renders each selected language twice and requires byte equality;
3. stages all outputs before changing the checkout;
4. writes atomically;
5. deletes only files owned by the previous manifest;
6. records schema and output hashes;
7. fails CI when checked-in output drifts.

Regenerate:

```bash
python3 cmux-tui/bindings/codegen/generate.py --write
```

Verify without writing:

```bash
python3 cmux-tui/bindings/codegen/generate.py --check
```

## Acceptance

Each language must pass:

- unit tests for IDs, selectors, requests, results, errors, redaction, and
  unknown variants;
- exact fake-server transcripts for ordering, cancellation, timeout, overflow,
  and idempotency;
- clean package installation and an external consumer build;
- catalog descriptor parity for every transported operation;
- a live isolated server flow that creates, runs, reads, mutates, streams, and
  closes resources;
- its minimum compiler or runtime version.

The repository-level boundary checker rejects private resource fields,
private identity forms, raw imports, and missing operation descriptors from
high-level packages.

The next likely SDKs are C# and Swift. They should follow this contract only
after the seven initial packages and protocol have shipped stable.
