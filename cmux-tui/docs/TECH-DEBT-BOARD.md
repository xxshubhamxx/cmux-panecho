`af31628f7b0b2f6c34e184049254fa2fe91f285d`. This branch changes documentation only.

Session evidence is now reported conservatively. The strict auditable turn
count is `unknown` (not zero) because durable session identifiers are absent.
The practical floor is five documented substantive owner workstreams.
The branch proxy is 96 TUI references, 78 with substantive non-merge commits;
it is not a turn count. Unresolved Claude intents are IDs
`1787650444261`, `1787650724161` (state ownership, manual I/O, reconnect),
`1787722163382`, `1787723964393` (remove Go daemon, direct I/O and tunnels),
`1787733887926`, `1787780735531` (machine terminals, VNC, attach, parity),
`1787794506089` (cloud tree per machine), `1787823710241` (sidebar split),
`1787825896700` (wheel-to-arrow behavior), and `1787826030510` (Claude
completion subscriptions). No completion evidence was found.

No new session scan ran. The retained lower bound is 258 named substantive
turns, not a total and not a 10,000-session claim. Later code merges require a
final refresh.

The session scan receipt and lower-bound ledger below remain retained audit
evidence. No new session scan was performed for this metadata refresh.
The retained receipt supports at least 258 named substantive turns. This is a
verifiable lower bound, not a total session count, and no 10,000-session claim
is made.

## Current delta since `5c2ee1244e2d796c9e4be5307788b320ac2ee4ff`

| Area | Current state at `87f31977237cbcbbf8b7f492718685d612fbb9b0` | Required proof or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace RPC response routing | Unknown responses fail the workspace RPC channel, and canceled request IDs are retired without exposing the local namespace. | Exercise unknown, late, canceled, and reconnect responses from multiple clients, then verify bounded failure and no request-ID leakage. |
| Escape input routing | Escape passthrough is integrated from #9810. | Exercise terminal, sidebar, and nested-frontend Escape behavior on the exact main snapshot. |
| Alternate-screen wheel policy | Wheel events use Ghostty wheel reporting with mouse tracking, and emit `ESC[A/B` three times when alternate-screen apps do not enable tracking. | Add a configurable alternate-scroll policy and modifier override, with behavior tests. Changing the default may break TUIs that rely on arrow sequences. |

## Historical snapshot retained: main `99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095`

The following sections preserve the prior board state captured at
2026-08-27T09:25:01Z. They are historical evidence, not current status.

Historical snapshot: 2026-08-27T09:25:01Z. The exact source baseline was
`origin/main` at [`99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095),
committed 2026-08-27T02:13:58-07:00. This board is append-only in spirit:
the current layer was first, and older sections are retained as historical
snapshots. No local Rust, Zig, or runtime build/test was run for that
documentation-only update.

## Historical residual debt at `99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095`

| Area | Current state at `99bdc375e9` | Required proof or next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability compatibility | Unknown capability names no longer fail decoding. | Exercise a newer remote capability through every client and verify safe feature gating. |
| Auth refresh ownership | Ownership and lifecycle are documented, not implemented end to end. | Add authenticated refresh, revocation, and expiry behavior tests without logging credentials. |
| Surface teardown scale | Reverse indexes reduce repeated lookups. | Run a 96-browser-tab teardown stress case and capture bounded latency and memory. |
| File and config security | Detached state and pairing config use owner and descriptor checks. | Prove cross-platform permissions, symlink rejection, and recovery after interruption. |
| Reader diagnostics | First termination reasons survive remote reader shutdown. | Surface EOF versus read failure in the UI and reconnect state machine. |
| Frame budgets | Client ingress and server egress limits are explicit. | Verify exact and oversized frame behavior across all SDKs and transports. |
| Canonical CLI docs | Public examples use resource-first commands. | Run fresh-package help and attach flows, and document compatibility aliases. |
| Error localization | Browser-control failures are localized at the UI boundary. | Exercise English and Japanese UI paths and verify no raw backend error leaks. |

## Session scan receipt and lower-bound ledger

The full local history scan found 90,787 parsed JSON records and 81,149 unique
Claude session IDs in `~/.claude/history.jsonl`, plus 18,833 records and 2,332
unique Codex session IDs in `~/.codex/history.jsonl`. The current tail receipt
is 174 Claude records and 42 IDs from line 90614 onward, with 26 records and 12
IDs matching selected TUI terms; Codex line 18787 onward has 47 records and 17
IDs, with two records and two IDs matching the narrow TUI terms. Broad full-file
keyword scans found 339 Claude IDs and 310 Codex IDs, but those include
unrelated requests and are not substantive counts.

The current board records at least 256 substantive turns. Local audit commit
`a6b54c6b0e469c72d527c5b9f7c165ed49bfa03d` (not on this main snapshot) records
one additional named documentation turn, and this update adds one more named
audit turn. The verifiable lower-bound ledger is therefore at least 258 named
substantive turns when those retained receipts are included. It excludes empty,
duplicate, self-counting, secret-bearing, and unrelated records. This is a
lower bound, not a total session count, and it makes no 10,000-session claim.

## Historical live PR state (2026-08-25)

This table was the live PR state in the 2026-08-25 snapshot. It is retained for

## Historical current state (2026-08-25)

The audited source tail is `75ddb6fbe84fb37ee8bcc75d0d96c39ec782e3e9`. It carries the watch compatibility,
queue-ownership, fairness, timer-bound, shell-reservation, PTY overflow,
preview saturation, SDK lifecycle, CLI grammar, capability documentation,
credential-child reaping, journal-writer ownership/finalization, explicit
socket cleanup, package-mode preservation, 8-bit C1 parser fixes, and inline
global CLI values, bounded preview and process cleanup, safe socket fallback
precedence, cancellation propagation, cross-platform root parsing, and SDK
clippy cleanup after the 25-file relay/TUI integration merge. The current tail
also adds per-attachment PTY delivery gates and generation-aware replacement
cleanup, a bounded legacy socket scan that tolerates per-entry metadata errors,
invalid Go write-progress handling, Java traversal coverage, and the current-main
package workflow simplification plus PyPI project-description metadata. The
latest tail also scopes remote-daemon cleanup to the failed writer, makes upload
creation descriptor-backed, and avoids signaling a numeric PID marker during
recovery. It makes close generation-aware, makes SSH upload staging no-clobber
and ownership explicit, classifies only verified missing resources as
`terminal_gone`, and documents the interactive/headless CLI split. The latest
tail adds child reaping on missing `git diff` stdout and generation-gated stale
PTY overflow errors in `ca12249636` and `75ddb6fbe8`. A same-user
pathname race remains a documented residual because the portable shell path has
no descriptor-relative `fchmod`. The issues below remain open.

The exact tail then adds a valid public-ID selector fixture (`663317e431`), a
typed `selector.not_found` assertion (`42e97c05c6`), Kitty quota timeout
admission coverage (`2597d7720d`), graceful timeout admission with disabled
Kitty graphics (`31857f0c4c`), the corrected applied-limit assertion
(`95fd2196df`), and the matching recovery comment (`ba16a6745e`). The current
tail then adds protocol v7 operational PTY error gating (`29145d800c`,
`cd76c82e3d`), cancellation retirement after partial writes (`2f3e478385`,
`ec074f4b53`), and bounded Git stderr ownership (`c4e842cc55`,
`e4f527bc00`).

### Wave 48 audit residuals

| Area | Current decision | Next proof or fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filesystem-watch replacement | P1 open. Old watch tasks can emit frames after replacement because the wire frames have no generation and task abort is not awaited. | Add a generation or stream token to event/error frames, or retire and await the old task before publishing the replacement. Keep ordered PTY/event frames on a queue, not a latest-value watcher. |
| Git child cleanup | P1/P2 open. `git status` and `git diff` have no operation deadline around stdout reads, and dropping `Child` is not strict descendant cleanup. | Add cancellation/deadline selection, process-group or job cleanup, and bounded kill plus `wait()` before returning. Test descendants that inherit stdout and stderr. |
| `run_spec` cleanup | P2 open. The drop guard signals a process group but does not await `Child::wait()`. | Use an owned async cleanup supervisor with escalation and a bounded reap. |
| Stale surface tree | P1 open in [#10743](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10743) and follow-up [#10747](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10747). The follow-up incorrectly treats an empty local attachment mirror as proof that the authoritative remote tab is stale. | Keep valid unattached server tabs for lazy startup and `--terminal`; filter only explicit detached/retired evidence, then add refresh-level startup and detach-boundary tests. |
| Preferred editor launch | P2 open in [#10681](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10681). The wrapper and quoting fixes are at `ff7685ddcd`, but `env -S "nvim --clean"` still fails the existing detector path. | Re-tokenize the `env -S` payload, then run focused Swift tests and exact-head review. |
| Remote upload marker cleanup | P2 open. Exact-head autoreview found PID reuse and malformed marker values can preserve stale payloads forever when cleanup trusts `kill -0`. | Use a fresh heartbeat marker and conservative stale-age reclaim without signaling marker PIDs, then add behavior tests for fresh, stale, malformed, and reused-PID cases. |
| `run_spec` cancellation reaping | P2 remains open in [#10746](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10746). A detached raw `waitpid` thread can accumulate and a narrow armed-guard window can target a reused PID. | Disarm immediately after normal wait, use an owned cleanup supervisor, and add a cancellation/reap behavior test. |

### Wave 45 audit residuals

| Area | Current decision | Next proof or fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R2 binary provenance | Raw R2 binaries still have SHA-256 manifests but no GitHub build attestation. npm and PyPI lanes have provenance checks. | Add an opt-in attestation path only after R2 consumers can verify the signer and subject digest. Do not grant broad OIDC permissions to the shared workflow before that contract exists. |
| Scale | Event fan-out and browser/resource selection use bounded linear scans. No measured hot-path regression proves an index is needed. | Capture an event-rate and 1,000-session profile before changing ownership or adding caches. |
| CLI ownership docs | Detached-owner commit `01bbc358e2` is not an ancestor of this branch. | Keep the current explicit lifecycle wording until the implementation lands and has behavior proof. |
| Same-UID remote staging | Portable shell still cannot provide descriptor-relative `fchmod` after hashing. | Keep the remote account private, or move staging to an implementation with an opened-directory and descriptor-based API. |
| Kitty quota timeout latency | Terminal admission now succeeds with graphics disabled, but it can still wait up to the two-second control deadline before degrading. | Replace the deadline wait only after measuring pane-split latency and adding a cancellable state transition. |

### Open issue inventory

| Issue | Evidence and acceptance |
| --- | --- |
| [#10395](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/10395) | `eprintln!` can corrupt TUI frames. Route diagnostics through the client log and prove raw-terminal bytes stay unchanged during attach, resize, and close. |
| [#10431](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/10431) | OSC-11 heredoc smoke input can drop bytes. Reproduce under parallel load and prove byte-for-byte paste delivery with bounded writes. |

| [#10426](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/10426) | Paint-before-pointer ordering was fixed by merged [PR #11019](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/11019). Keep a regression proof if this path changes; do not reopen the old race without a new failure. |
| [#7126](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/7126) | Cmd-V can send one character. Prove complete Unicode paste in bracketed and non-bracketed modes. |
| [#8346](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/8346) | Open-file-in-editor feature request. Define launch, focus, save/close, and reconnect behavior first. |
| [#10034](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/10034) | `preferredEditor` can leak editor and Node children. Prove process-group cleanup on success, cancel, crash, and app exit. |
| [#4890](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4890), [#4733](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/4733) | SSH loss/reconnect can leak mouse, focus, or Kitty bytes. Prove protocol-state reset on both paths. |
| [#8285](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/8285) | Width shrinks but may not widen. Prove bidirectional resize through daemon, PTY, and TUI under rapid changes. |
| [#2688](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/2688) | Child PTYs can still wait on DSR replies. cmux-tui's own startup probe is single-reader and bounded to 180 ms, but no-reply first-frame latency lacks hosted wall-clock proof. Add that behavior proof before tuning; do not add a second stdin reader. |
| [#1059](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/1059) | OSC-11 is not passed through. Prove request/reply forwarding and missing-color behavior. |
| [#5490](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5490) | CSI 996/997/2031 theme protocol is missing. Add protocol behavior tests before claiming support. |
| [#2396](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/2396) | Large `cmux send` can freeze. Bound admission and prove completion under backpressure and bracketed paste. |
| [#3051](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/3051) | Scrollbar changes can oscillate PTY size. Prove resize coalescing and stable dimensions. |
| [#2588](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/2588) | Child PTYs may miss terminal size. Prove `TIOCSWINSZ` at spawn and after resize. |
| [#5138](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5138) | Large multiline paste can lose its middle. Prove complete bounded buffering or surfaced rejection. |

The exact current tip is always available with `git rev-parse HEAD` in the
worktree. The shared primary checkout was dirty before this run. One
pre-existing primary-checkout smoke-script commit (`9a23d9a4f1`) was preserved
and cherry-picked as `b2f1d149fd`; no primary changes were discarded. Current
integration work is isolated in this worktree.

The branch contains browser lookup and pending-enrollment bounds, runtime and
relay error hardening, a `SessionPort` projection boundary, resize coalescing,
pipe framing and PTY short-write fixes, Kitty and graphics flake tests, relay
task ownership and shutdown joins, reconnect cancellation, socket path
validation and digest fallback across SDKs, journal decompression preallocation,
and documentation cleanup. Rust verification remains hosted-only under
`AGENTS.md`.

The socket contract extraction initially removed the live `client-focus` and
`report-focus` commands. The integration branch restores both commands and
keeps the contract changes. Go, schema, resource-boundary, spec-inventory, and
publish-workflow checks pass after that repair.

## Architecture decision

Use Ghostty manual-IO for daemon-backed surfaces. The app will own one direct
byte pump (daemon replay, live output, raw input, resize, and close status)
instead of spawning `cmux-tui attach` inside a nested PTY. Keep the daemon as
the durable owner of terminal and layout state. Migrate in this order:
`--pipe-io` proof, pump-owned resize/close, native `cmux.protocol/2` client,
then removal of the exec-attach bridge. This records the user request from
round 9B; no manual-IO proof exists yet.

## Completed request chains

| Request | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier-A daemon attach and quit/reopen survival | [PR 10408](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10408) | First pass complete. Known cuts: launchd supervision, first-tab/split coverage, cwd/env, orphan cleanup. |
| Journal topology survives terminal exit | [PR 10413](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10413) | Complete for exit preservation. Checkpoints and agent launch specs remain open. |
| Scoped attach mouse/cursor correctness | [PR 10428](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10428) | Safe host-state and cursor fixes are integrated here. The PR's diagnostic PTY tap remains excluded because its writes can block under backpressure. |
| Checkpoint capture race | [PR 10501](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10501) | Complete for bounded, non-destructive capture. Journal growth/GC is still open. |
| Terminal close and liveness reporting | [PR 10513](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10513) | Complete for tested host loss and daemon loss paths. Exact round-7 trigger remains unproven. |
| Spec-only plan | [PR 10388](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10388) | Closed by direction. Specs must land with implementation. |

## Open requests and acceptance work

Session-mined product and infrastructure requests are tracked in
[`USER-REQUEST-BOARD.md`](USER-REQUEST-BOARD.md). The current open items include
stale surface references, base-image installation, relay onboarding and token
ownership, PTY resize ordering, replaceable sleeps, and attach simplification.

| Request | Acceptance gap | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual-IO transport | `--pipe-io` PoC must render live output, accept typing/mouse, replay on relaunch, and prove one reply authority. | Next implementation slice. |

## Change log and revert guidance

### Wave-1 commits

| Commit | Change | Proof / residual risk | Revert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `352c3a2ebb` | Index browser sources once per refreshed remote tree; preserve pre-refresh browser lookup. | `git diff --check`; hosted Rust test still required. | Revert this commit only; the old tree scan returns, with the prior scale cost. |
| `bedc018adb` | Add path context to Chrome profile setup errors and decode OS hostnames lossily. | Behavior test is in `ab674165c8`; hosted Rust test still required. | Revert both runtime commits together to restore the old error behavior. |
| `ab674165c8` | Add invalid-UTF-8 and empty-hostname behavior coverage. | Test is deterministic and platform-gated; hosted Rust test required. | Revert with `bedc018adb`. |
| `0e8a47209f` | Make `server start/status/stop/attach` canonical and remove obsolete browser/profile setup steps. | `git diff --check`; docs-only. | Revert this commit; no runtime state changes. |
| `aab58dd6d7` | Make CI read the pinned `rust-toolchain.toml` instead of workflow-specific Rust versions. | Workflow/static guard checks; hosted SDK and relay jobs required. | Revert this commit; CI returns to duplicated pins. |
| `16942a5d49` | Add a `SessionPort` snapshot boundary shared by local and remote sessions. | Behavior test compares the port with the existing topology read; hosted Rust test required. | Revert this commit; the frontend uses the direct enum again. |
| `e09f068dc4` | Convert relay slot/circuit invariant panics into atomic explicit errors. | `git diff --check`; hosted relay tests required. | Revert this commit; the old invariant panics return. |
| `eaa7108e9b` | Add this durable board and request log. | Markdown only. | Revert this commit; code remains unchanged. |

The integration branch can be reverted safely by reverting the rows in reverse
order. Do not revert the manual-IO bridge until its replacement has a hosted
red/green behavior proof.

- `PR 10408`: app bridge, quit policy, close semantics, config isolation, and
  TERM propagation. Revert its app commits together if removing the spike;
  keep daemon journal changes only with an explicit owner.
- `PR 10428`: replay mouse-wire-format and scoped attach fixes. Revert the
  serialization and client encoder as one unit; otherwise reattach can regress
  to urxvt encoding.
- `PR 10501`: checkpoint snapshot locking and quiet failure handling. Revert
  only with a replacement bounded-capture design; the old path disconnected
  healthy hosts.
- `PR 10513`: liveness sweep, reconnect give-up notices, and client exit
  reasons. Revert as one chain, then restore the prior exit-state contract.
- Manual-IO work: each slice must have a red behavior test before the fix and
  a hosted green run before removing bridge code. Revert by disabling the flag
  and retaining the existing bridge until the next slice is ready.

## Explicit blockers

1. No manual-IO implementation or end-to-end proof exists yet.
2. Journal size and WAL checkpoint latency can still create terminal-output
   admission stalls; prevention is not claimed.
3. launchd supervision, reboot checkpoints, and full agent restore are not
   implemented.
4. Cloud TUI acceptance remains a product-sized backlog, not a completed
   cmux-tui change.
5. `AdminServer` and `UnixServer` still detach accepted connection tasks;
   explicit shutdown awaits listeners but not all admitted work. A future
   cancellation-token design must thread through dispatch and WebSocket
   upgrades before claiming deterministic shutdown.
6. GitStatus and GitDiff children use `kill_on_drop`, but the generic timeout
   can drop the future before an explicit kill-and-reap await. A cleanup design
   must retain child ownership without letting descendants or permits escape.
7. Over-capacity or duplicate relay `Incoming` frames are intentionally dropped
   today. The wire protocol has no bounded rejection frame, so adding one needs
   a protocol decision.
8. The exact-head hosted run `32640497665` is running against `14bf092017`.
   It includes the shared Crossterm event-reader helper and its behavior test.
9. Attach passthrough PR [#10428](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10428)
   is not merge-ready. Its artifact downloads returned 404, and its diagnostic
   PTY tap still has blocking I/O, process-group, and log-permission risks.
   Rebase and remove or repair that tap before treating the PR as a base for
   liveness work.
10. This aggregate has no local Rust compile or test evidence. Treat every
    Rust behavior claim above as pending hosted verification, even where a
    focused source or diff check passed.
11. Credential-command failures now kill and reap their child on every error
    path. Generic relay child timeout and cancellation paths still lack a
    durable cancellation token and awaited ownership for every relay child.
12. Durable Objects integration is not implemented. Cloud TUI lifecycle,
    persistence, and reconnect claims must not be inferred from the local
    relay and SDK hardening in this branch.

Hosted cross-language verification pending. Residual risk is intentional behavior change for callers that passed empty text to path-only helpers. | Revert all four socket-contract commits together, then restore the old path contract explicitly. |

| `e6c6982f6b` | Pin the Rust SDK runtime hash dependency. | Package checks are currently blocked by the failing protocol-contract job. | Revert this dependency correction. |
| `0b9f15b16d`, `03a89e19e4`, `bf89159826`, `31a8df3561` | Reject derived or empty lifecycle socket sessions before dialing, cover the invalid-session behavior, and localize the new errors. | Behavior coverage is present; exact-head protocol and inventory checks currently fail. | Revert the lifecycle validation commits together, then restore the old path-only behavior. |
| `cdac79f024`, `93b900c945` | Prune completed relay request tasks and abort detached admin listeners on drop. | Guard checks pass; hosted relay lifecycle coverage remains required. | Revert both ownership fixes together. |

## Wave-4 change log

| Commit | Change | Proof / residual risk | Revert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `029866fc51` | Apply the hosted Rust formatter output to the integration tip. | Hosted artifact identified the exact formatting delta; `git diff --check` passed. | Revert this style-only commit. |
| `64aa7df959` | Cap pending chatmux-relay workspace requests at 64 per connection and refuse excess work with the existing typed `failed` code. | Behavioral cap test and diff check; hosted Rust test required. A fixed cap can refuse legitimate bursts, so clients must retry. | Revert this commit to restore unbounded task admission. |
| `ff1095b6ed` | Replace the global artifact glibc claim with `runtimeByBinary` OS, architecture, and libc metadata while preserving checksum maps. | No in-org consumer reads the old field. External consumers may need migration. | Revert this workflow commit and restore the old manifest contract only with a consumer plan. |
| `60fcf83ef6` | Route runtime diagnostics through the bounded client log so raw-terminal ownership is not corrupted by `eprintln!`. | Diff check passed; hosted TUI runtime coverage remains required. | Revert this app logging commit. |
| `1c7910a717` | Flush terminal query replies after every parser command, including resize, defaults, clear-history, and drain. | Diff check passed; a capture-writer parser-loop test is still needed. | Revert this parser flush commit. |
| `737bd68689` | Bound SSH bootstrap child reaping to a two-second cleanup grace period after kill. | Diff check passed; hosted remote timeout test required. | Revert this cleanup bound. |
| `5b5de3f648` | Stop cancelling an active exact-commit TUI verification run when a newer request is queued. | `actionlint` passed; hosted workflow run required. Release workflows intentionally keep their own cancellation policy. | Revert this workflow guard. |
| `4b054f4eb8` | Add a dedicated Rust 1.88 MSRV job for public SDK crates and examples while keeping the workspace toolchain checks. | PyYAML and diff checks passed; hosted SDK run required. | Revert this CI coverage addition, which would permit MSRV drift. |
| `86ebb29994` | Correct `docs/remote.md` to describe static musl Linux packages instead of an incorrect glibc floor. | Docs-only; package contract and release docs agree. | Revert this documentation correction. |
| `a2cffdf6c8`, `8712d2f0e2` | Bound non-abortable relay filesystem/search work with eight shared blocking permits and keep the formatting canonical. | The cap bounds work that can outlive a disconnect; queued requests remain cancellable, while admitted closures can still finish. Hosted relay tests remain required. | Revert both commits together to restore unbounded blocking-pool admission. |
| `6e15ea5f38` | Document the `runtimeByBinary` raw-release contract, including per-file libc and package-specific wheel tags. | Docs match the generated manifest; external consumers still need to adopt the new field. | Revert this documentation commit only. |
| `d76bc5539b` | Admit GitStatus and GitDiff through the shared eight-permit pool and build scopes on the blocking pool before filesystem validation. | Prevents cross-connection process admission growth and async-runtime filesystem stalls. Hosted Rust verification required. | Revert this commit with `51a66ad061` to restore the prior Git/scope path. |
| `51a66ad061` | Apply the hosted formatter output for the shared admission helper. | `git diff --check` passed; exact hosted Rust formatter rerun required. | Revert this style-only commit. |
| `14bf092017` | Extract one injected Crossterm event-reader helper for blocking and timed input, with behavior coverage for poll/read ordering. | `git diff --check` passed; hosted run `32640497665` is required for Rust compilation and tests. | Revert this commit to restore duplicated input branches. |

## Aggregate socket, relay, and recovery tail

| Commit range | Change | Proof / residual risk | Revert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `7a9788b3f4` through `6eb2e4293e` | Apply the legacy hashed-session socket fallback consistently across Python, TypeScript, Rust, Java, Zig, and C++ resource clients, including Unix socket headers where required. | Cross-SDK behavior is aligned at the source level; no local Rust compile or test was run. Hosted SDK and protocol checks remain required. | Revert the SDK fallback commits as one compatibility change, then restore the previous hashed-only contract deliberately. |
| `c254984b62` | Bound Unix JSON-line readers so a peer cannot grow an unbounded frame or line in memory. | Diff and source checks pass; hosted Rust coverage is required. The limit is a protocol policy and may reject oversized future messages. | Revert this bound only with an explicit replacement limit. |
| `cbd64255b9`, `12f1d29eb2` | Validate wire identity during capability preflight and cover the mismatch behavior. | Prevents a capability reply from being accepted for the wrong connection. Rust compile/test remains hosted-only. | Revert both commits together to restore capability-only preflight. |
| `696c600f67` | Recover valid config sections independently so one malformed section does not discard unrelated configuration. | Recovery behavior is covered by focused tests; hosted Rust verification remains required. | Revert this recovery change to restore all-or-nothing parsing. |
| `d6f92ad2b4`, `f04c5409a0` | Add and localize mux recovery status messaging. | English and Japanese localization paths are updated; exact-head hosted UI/runtime verification remains open. | Revert the test and localization commits together. |
| `3adcaf2c78` | Quote systemd `ExecStart` arguments safely for paths and values containing shell metacharacters. | Static and diff checks pass; hosted packaging/install verification remains required. | Revert this service-unit quoting fix only with a replacement escaping rule. |

Rejected or deferred after review: PTY resize error handling was already fixed
by `80f40831dac`; Kitty transient-status suppression is already present as
`96fdc46b8d` and `cacbc23b06`; the TypeScript socket proposal `866e94d5d2`
would remove the current digest fallback; detached admin and Unix connection
tasks need a cancellation design, not a blind `JoinSet`; PR #10513's liveness
fix depends on its unmerged feature stack; PR #10521 still has journal-scan
complexity and host-state publication findings beyond its compile fixes.

- Ratatui rendering and component architecture: `https://ratatui.rs/concepts/rendering/`, `https://www.ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/component-architecture/`.
- Tokio shutdown and task ownership: `https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/shutdown`, `https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/struct.JoinSet.html`.

- SQLite WAL and recovery guidance: `https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html`, `https://www.sqlite.org/transactional.html`.

These sources support the current decisions: one event reader, one PTY writer,
complete short writes, bounded queues, cooperative cancellation with awaited
shutdown, immediate-mode rendering from durable state, and bounded journal
decompression. They do not justify copying a 60 FPS template or adding a
second state store.

## Wave-5 integration findings

| Commit | Change | Proof / residual risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1094385e7f` | Import the private TUI test helpers through their supported module path. | Resolves hosted test import failures; hosted compile remains the authority. |
| `647e9721aa` | Localize the remaining TUI status-error strings. | English and Japanese keys are present; audit future status paths for bare literals. |
| `229eddbe5d` | Bound host input polling during shutdown. | Removes an unbounded wait from the close path; cancellation and host-loss coverage remain required. |
| `35132cda6c` | Localize browser-pane status copy. | Browser status now uses the shared localization table; verify every browser state in UI review. |
| `ec21e4d847` | Cover bounded host-input polling with a deterministic test. | Test exercises the timeout boundary; hosted compile and focused test are still required. |

The hosted compile failure was an import-resolution problem in the private test
helper, not a runtime protocol failure. The helper import is now explicit in
`1094385e7f`; rerun the exact-head hosted job before calling the sequence green.
The event-loop row is now bounded at shutdown, while normal input ownership is
still centralized in the shared reader. Localization is partial by design: the
recent status and browser paths are covered, but new UI copy must still enter
the localization table.

## Session findings

Recent `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` sessions confirm three durable requests:
hosted compile failures must report the first failing import and the resolved
module path; localization must cover status and browser state copy in every
supported language; and event-loop shutdown must use a bounded, cancellable
poll with deterministic behavior coverage. No session evidence proves full
session restore, cloud-TUI lifecycle completion, or manual-IO replacement, so
those remain open requests above.

## Wave-8 current state and audit inventory (2026-08-23)

The integration tip for this section was `638e536f03`; the aggregate tip is
`7a0f71692f`. Localization recovery is a two-commit
chain: `01c4a2de8d` restores the missing catalog/source entries and
`638e536f03` restores the mux-recovery status path. Keep both commits together
until English and Japanese runtime coverage is green.

### PR inventory and supersession

| Release stack PRs | Overlapping release, packaging, and verification changes | Keep one linear release stack; rebase each child and rerun exact-head checks before merge. |

### Mined intents and acceptance

| Intent | Evidence path | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PTY ownership must have one writer and explicit lifecycle ownership. | `~/.claude/paste-cache/18bda3edc0facc99.txt`; `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-tui/src/pty.rs`; `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-tui/src/app.rs` | One owner handles writes, resize, close, and cancellation; short writes are complete; shutdown awaits the owner; no nested attach PTY. |
| Linux terminals need a built cmux-tui backend selected by `CMUX_TUI_BINARY`. | `~/.claude/paste-cache/18bda3edc0facc99.txt`; `cmux-tui/docs/remote.md`; launcher/config paths under `cmux-tui/` | A clean Linux install resolves the configured binary, reports a clear missing-binary error, and renders attach, input, resize, and reconnect. |
| SSH aggregation needs machine-rail host add/edit and remote TUI attach. | `~/.codex/sessions/2026/08/04/rollout-2026-08-04T17-17-26-019fcf48-3fce-73f0-b5f6-8626631c8cb5.jsonl`; `~/.codex/sessions/2026/07/25/rollout-2026-07-25T20-51-15-019f9c8c-684c-7070-ad8d-3960d8e8f0f8.jsonl` | Credentials and host keys stay in the host boundary; add/edit, authenticated attach, reconnect/close, and per-machine/per-window focus each have behavior tests. |
| Scrollbar parity must match native terminal behavior. | `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-tui/src/ui/`; `cmux-tui/docs/`; session-mining records in `~/.claude` | Scroll thumb tracks durable scrollback, wheel/drag/page keys agree, resize preserves position, and accessibility exposes the same actions. |

### Current-state change log and revert

On 2026-08-23 this board moved its declared tip from `3d47d1d537` to
`638e536f03`, documented the localization recovery chain, and added the audit
supersession and mined-intent tables. This is documentation only. Revert this
board change as one commit if the integration tip or audit conclusions change;
do not revert either localization commit independently from a tested replacement.

Residual risks remain: hosted exact-head verification is still required, manual
IO is not implemented, PTY and SSH ownership boundaries are incomplete, and
scrollbar parity has no end-to-end evidence. The PR inventory is an audit
snapshot, so statuses can become stale when GitHub heads change.
| `6828f9fa9d` | Explain the common top-level `command` config mistake and point to `commands`. | The guidance matches current serde validation. Error wording matching is a small residual risk. | Revert this diagnostic-only commit. |

The debug PTY tap from [PR 10428](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10428)
is deliberately not in this branch. Its current implementation can block on
PTY or stdout writes, so it can stop signal forwarding and terminal restore.
Its logs also needed restrictive permissions and its signal path needed process
group forwarding. The safe group and permission fixes exist in an isolated
follow-up, but nonblocking queued I/O is still required before the tool can be
accepted.

| `~/.claude/paste-cache/65dcbaea177f5811.txt:100-110` | `space_open_pane` should open a terminal directly instead of requiring `enable_sandbox_terminal`. | Open simplification request. Keep the sandbox ownership boundary until a direct create-and-attach behavior test exists. |
| `~/.claude/history.jsonl:25096` | Create a workspace and attach in one command. | Open CLI simplification request. Existing create and attach paths need one shared receipt before combining them. |
| `~/.claude/history.jsonl:21099`, `23606`, `23635` | Reboot restore must preserve tabs, scrollback, focus, and split layout. | Open. `ensure_initial` is already idempotent, so the remaining gap is journal adoption and process restoration, not another startup mutation patch. |

These references support the current decisions: preserve ambiguous legacy bytes,
use a versioned protocol for future explicit mouse metadata, centralize host
state ownership, and bound event polling and task admission.

The current integration branch is not a claim that every open TUI PR is safe.
PR [#10254](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10254) still needs C++
parity and an ordered legacy fallback probe. PR [#10522](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10522)
has a pushed provider-menu fix awaiting exact-head checks and review. Aggregate
PR [#10603](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10603) has an explicit
cleanup contract in [#10604](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10604),
but child-process group reaping still needs a separate implementation and
behavior test.

## Simplification audit and residual risks

The audit removes duplicate socket fallback branches, keeps one bounded path
validator per client, and keeps one shared terminal log boundary. Go now retains
minimal fallback state, C++ attachment reports classified errno failures, and
Rust fallback errors carry path context. These are principled contract
reductions, not timing workarounds. Remaining risks are unchanged: no local
Rust compile evidence, no manual-IO end-to-end proof, incomplete cancellation
and child reaping, unresolved PTY resize and paste issues, and stale GitHub
status snapshots. The issue and PR rows above do not claim those items are
fixed.

## Residual risks after Waves 19 and 20

The following risks remain open and are not implied to be fixed by the latest
commits:

- PTY inbound data can still exceed a bounded lifecycle unless every producer
  has an admission limit and cancellation path.
- Workspace producer queues now have bounds in several paths, but ownership of
  a queued item across disconnect, shutdown, and retry is not fully proven.
- Relative PTY cwd input is now rejected or normalized in more paths. A stable
  documented relative-cwd migration contract and compatibility test are still
  required.
- No local Rust compile or end-to-end hosted result is claimed here. Manual-IO,
  durable restore, cloud lifecycle, and complete child reaping remain open.

The ledger still records at least 205 substantive agent turns. It counts named
audits, fixes, reviews, and merge gates, and excludes empty or duplicate turns.
The requested 10,000-session target is not reached, and no sessions are being
created to inflate the count.

## Wave 20 follow-up, current aggregate tip

The code tip advanced from `8c5f808302` through the following bounded
security, ingress, and metadata commits. These entries preserve the earlier
Wave 20 decisions and do not convert an implementation slice into a completed
product request.

## Residual risks, updated

- Workspace producer queues have bounds in multiple paths, but a queued item
  can still outlive its producer across disconnect, retry, and shutdown. The
  ownership contract needs a behavior test, not another numeric cap.
- PTY inbound saturation now fails closed at one ingress boundary. Every
  producer path still needs a bounded admission decision and cancellation
  proof before claiming global backpressure safety.
- Relative cwd rejection is safer than accepting ambiguous paths, but callers
  need a documented absolute/home-relative migration contract.

The ledger remains an honest lower bound of at least 205 substantive agent
turns. It does not represent an exact session-file count, and the requested
10,000-session target is not reached.

## Wave 21 change log and current protocol audit

The exact aggregate code tip before this documentation commit is
`4efcee9a19f55322bc16cde24e2e54dade445ae9`. The rows below preserve the
pre-`cc374f8af6` ingress foundations that are part of the current tip, then
record the workspace, metadata, cleanup, Java, and protocol commits after that
tip. No row claims complete product-level backpressure or restore behavior.

Strict-tab cleanup and Java connect timeout are no longer residual defects in
this board. Remaining risks are narrower: the byte-bounded workspace producer
bridge still needs end-to-end ownership and cancellation proof; synchronous
canonicalization can still block a request path; validation and later use can
still have a TOCTOU window; and relative cwd migration needs a documented
absolute/home-relative contract.

## Wave 22 bounded transport tail

The exact aggregate code tip immediately before this board commit is
`b61f1bada6498ee9d6549f4550f9a062f327f22c`. The companion
`TECH-DEBT-CHANGELOG.md` is a historical snapshot at an older tip. This table
is the current revert map. A bound at one ingress edge is not a claim of global
backpressure or complete remote-session recovery.

Generic relay child timeout and cancellation paths still need a durable cancellation token and awaited ownership. | Revert this credential-child lifecycle fix with its error-path coverage. |
| [`fb3ac754c5`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/fb3ac754c5d55869f968289e3906e3b6b6b0872e) | Reserve journal-writer ownership before spawn and make `Mux` drop close and join the writer. | Duplicate writers cannot start and the owner state is explicit. Durable gap delivery still depends on a lifecycle owner calling `shutdown` before releasing the final `Arc<Mux>`. | Revert the writer owner-state and `Mux` drop changes together. |
| [`ab2b944ab8`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/ab2b944ab81a2ebf09a0c595b185344665f9c74f) | Hand a journal writer self-join to a reaper thread. | A writer that drops the last `Mux` owner no longer deadlocks waiting on itself. Reaper creation and panic reporting still need hosted shutdown coverage. | Revert the self-join handoff and its behavior test together. |
| [`5f8860398e`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/5f8860398ee30e255f37cc5e8633159fb0058aa1) and [`09190e6da9`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/09190e6da92b60a60000913b9cbf9931ea4b94c7) | Coordinate journal finalization through shared completion state and apply the hosted formatter output. | Concurrent closers wait for one join result, and terminal-reader drain, gap emission, and writer close share one path. Late queued bytes during self-drop remain best-effort until the lifecycle owner calls `shutdown`. | Revert finalization and formatting as one writer-lifecycle chain. |
| [`5f6bf91e76`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/5f6bf91e760c1feb97671aa19f800e3e4f80674d) and [`c8ec5be775`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/c8ec5be775352f54acb0707abc13efa6e4be163b), [`44a2f05134`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/44a2f0513465da2e81c484319f2e44827a0491d8) | Make Rust SDK hashed-to-legacy fallback tests bindable, construct hashed endpoints in a safe runtime directory, and apply hosted formatting. | Tests no longer depend on an overlong legacy socket path or an unbound endpoint. Cross-language fallback, long-path, and hosted Rust verification remain required. | Revert the fallback test and formatting commits together. |
| [`8523b8f715`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/8523b8f7151bdb032d011cb512a32e878fc813da) | Give Zig fallback results an explicit `ResolvedConnection` type. | The connection and owned path contract is named at the API boundary. Zig allocator and cross-platform fallback tests remain required. | Revert the Zig type-naming change independently. |
| [`782fba0f2a`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/782fba0f2abe4f41c74a060caffa36a9c3efc73d) | Create missing parents for an explicit socket path and reject symlink or non-directory parents. | Explicit custom paths now work in a new nested directory without changing existing directory permissions. Parent replacement races and later bind authority checks remain open. | Revert explicit-parent preparation and its behavior test together. |
| [`f5fdf26ccd`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/f5fdf26ccd8f931623adabe711b898b47665d722) and [`80fd1621fa`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/80fd1621fa8dfa5b25b5767f9711c8afa15e5b65) | Unlink Unix sockets synchronously on server-wrapper drop, verify the published inode, and retain the path lease until the listener task drops. | A dropped wrapper no longer leaves a stale pathname while its accept task is pending, and replacement sockets are not unlinked by an old owner. Accepted-task shutdown and multi-process path races remain open. | Revert synchronous cleanup and lease retention together. |
| [`11c309d701`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/11c309d7013a5be96a9bc0d00a44f7b75e850399) | Preserve executable mode for npm relay and client launchers during packaging. | The package script restores execute bits in generated output, and checked-in launchers carry mode `100755`. Registry-install and offline smoke evidence remain required. | Revert the package-mode guard and launcher mode changes together. |
| [`c56afcad5f`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/c56afcad5fe8ba0c1583e9b8f53335faaeeb4e3a) and [`ace9e5f57f`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/ace9e5f57fb7e98d45aa8a22cdf2efa0fac09ec6) | Test and parse 8-bit C1 CSI and string introducers in cursor provenance, including split chunks and C1 ST termination. | C1 forms no longer pass through as ordinary payload, so cursor authorship and reset behavior match their 7-bit forms. Full ECMA-48, cross-platform rendering, and Ghostty parity remain unverified. | Revert the C1 parser and focused tests together. |

## Open user intents mined from `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`

These records are requests, not completion evidence. Every row remains open
unless its acceptance column says that a narrow implementation slice exists.

| Intent | Evidence path and lines | Acceptance and current status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session catalog, device identity, and one canonical session across devices. | `/Users/lawrence/.codex/history.jsonl:18409,18422,18428`; `/Users/lawrence/.claude/history.jsonl:20261,20280` | A fresh TUI starts with one session, workspace, screen, and terminal. A catalog exposes stable device and session IDs. macOS and iPhone attach to the same canonical session, and a multi-device rail can reorder without creating duplicates. Open. |
| Resize geometry must not leave blank space. | `/Users/lawrence/.codex/history.jsonl:2314,5160` | Reproduce resize and split transitions with scrollback, backing scale, and embedded web content. Prove point and pixel geometry stay consistent, with no blank terminal or web regions after repeated resize. The audit records a unit mismatch and repeated blank-space reports; this remains an open user request. |
| Same-cwd session-to-surface mapping and restoration. | `/Users/lawrence/.codex/history.jsonl:12793,1596` | Expose one diagnostic mapping for durable session, workspace, pane, surface, cwd, and session directory. Restore a session to its own cwd and surface, never a subagent's cwd or a stale surface.

## Residual risks after Wave 25 integration

- Several queues now have byte and count caps, but a workspace producer can
  still outlive its consumer across disconnect, retry, and shutdown. Ownership,
  cancellation, and permit release need an end-to-end behavior test.
- PTY output admission checks a complete frame at one boundary. Raw attach
  backlog overflow now emits `pty_error` code `overflow` and closes the
  affected attachment, but replay, process-group cleanup, client reattach, and
  loss reporting still need an end-to-end contract.
- Synchronous canonicalization and filesystem work can block a request path.
  Validation and later use still have a parent-directory TOCTOU window. The
  workspace path bounds do not make that parent immutable between check and use.
- Relative PTY cwd migration needs a documented absolute or home-relative
  contract. Existing rejection is safer, but it can break old callers.
- Iroh connection teardown can wait for a long pre-auth timeout. Tie link
  shutdown to connection cancellation before claiming prompt cleanup.
- The renderer transcript has no live worker PID or completed IOSurface proof.
  No render or PTY performance result is claimed.
- No local Rust compile or end-to-end hosted result is claimed in this board.
  Cross-language packaging, relay, restore, and remote attach remain open.
- Journal writer ownership and finalization now have explicit reservation,
  joining, self-join handoff, and shared-completion states. Hooks and providers
  still need one append boundary, one reducer owner, idempotency receipts, and
  explicit shutdown ordering. Late self-drop gaps remain best-effort, and the
  intent audit does not prove restart recovery.
- The new Java, Zig, Go, C++, TypeScript, and Rust SDK fallback changes have
  focused evidence only. No local Rust compile is claimed, and hosted SDK,
  MSRV, reconnect, packaging, and cross-language behavior results remain
  required.
- Unix socket cleanup now checks device and inode and retains the lease through
  listener-task drop. Parent-directory replacement, accepted-task shutdown,
  and multi-process races remain open.
- The C1 parser handles the covered CSI and string forms, but complete terminal
  control parity and measured renderer behavior remain open.
- Credential-command failures now reap children on all listed error paths.
  Generic relay and Git child timeout paths still need explicit cancellation
  and awaited process-group cleanup.
- The 25-file merge includes resolved TypeScript transport conflicts and broad
  native session/UI changes. Exact-head compile, protocol, and behavior review
  of that merge remains required; the merge itself is not acceptance evidence.
- Java connect-timeout and strict-tab cleanup are recorded as addressed in
  Wave 21. Do not re-list them as current defects without a new reproduction.
- Global CLI values now accept standard `--flag=value` syntax. Nested command
  options retain their previous grammar and need a separate compatibility decision.
- Preview target listeners are capped at 32 with LRU eviction, duplicate CDP
  request IDs no longer grow the order deque, and injected HTML is limited to
  8 MiB and 30 seconds. Hosted relay behavior still needs exact-head proof.
- Windows relay exec now uses a Job Object with kill-on-close and a bounded
  final wait. Hosted Windows compile and descendant cleanup evidence remain.
- Go and TypeScript no longer probe a raw `/tmp` socket when a fitting runtime
  path exists. TypeScript package compilation was unavailable locally because
  `tsc` is not installed; hosted SDK checks remain required.
- Python cleanup propagates cancellation of its shared task without spinning.
  The focused and full Python suites pass, but hosted cross-language checks
  remain required.
- Windows drive-prefix parent creation and platform-separated allowed-root
  parsing now have source-level tests. Hosted Windows execution remains the
  acceptance boundary.

The ledger remains an honest lower bound of at least 205 substantive agent
turns. It is not an exact session-file count. The requested 10,000-session
target is not reached, and no empty sessions were created to inflate it.
