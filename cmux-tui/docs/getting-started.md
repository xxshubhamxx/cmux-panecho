# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Builds need Zig 0.16.0, a Rust toolchain, and the `ghostty` submodule. `ghostty-vt-sys` compiles `libghostty-vt.a` from that submodule, so an uninitialized submodule fails before the TUI starts.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo build -p cmux-tui
```

## Local session

A normal run starts an in-process mux, opens the TUI, and serves the control socket.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- --session agents
```

The default session is `main`. Quitting a local TUI shuts down that in-process session and removes its socket.

Press `Ctrl-b` to reveal the active prefix commands in the bottom bar. Press `Ctrl-b ?` for the full scrollable shortcut list. Right-click a pane for pane actions, or anywhere in the sidebar for sidebar actions; hold Shift while right-clicking when an inner terminal app owns mouse input.

Use `--term <value>` to set `TERM` for child PTYs. Without it, children get `xterm-256color`; the terminal runtime also honors `CMUX_TUI_TERM` when no CLI value is supplied, with `CMUX_MUX_TERM` retained as a legacy fallback.

## Headless server and attach

Headless mode starts only the mux backend and control socket.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- --headless --session agents
```

Attach a TUI to that session from another terminal.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- attach --session agents
```

Detach from an attached TUI with prefix `d`. With default keys, that is `Ctrl-b d`. The server keeps running, and another `attach` reconnects to the same tree. PTY tabs attach with a Ghostty VT-state replay followed by a live output stream.

PTY programs may emit inline images with the Kitty graphics protocol. cmux-tui preserves those images across local, attached, and remote sessions when the outer terminal supports Kitty graphics, subject to the configured replay and transport byte limits; graphics beyond the replay budget may be omitted.

Attach one terminal without the sidebar, status bar, pane border, or other tabs:

```bash
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- attach --session agents --terminal <terminal-id>
```

Use the noun-first public CLI to inspect or automate individual resources:

```bash
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- workspace list
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- workspace current run -- cargo test
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- terminal term_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef attach --jsonl
```

Resource selectors accept a typed opaque ID, `current`, or an exact name. Names need not be unique. An ambiguous name returns every candidate ID without changing state.

## Remote machines

The optional machine rail keeps rendering local while it connects individual sessions through Unix sockets or SSH. It is disabled for the default local run and activates when `machine_sidebar.enabled` is true or `machines` contains a valid entry in `cmux-tui.json`. The SSH connector shares the managed lifecycle used by `cmux-tui ssh`: it checks the remote binary, starts the named headless mux and sidecar on demand, and reconnects without nesting a second TUI. Packaged releases can install their pinned remote binary. Source builds require the exact matching binary to be installed remotely.

Packaged clients use the same configuration and can start with:

```bash
npx cmux
```

See [Machines](machines.md) for Unix and SSH examples, rail input, and remote setup.

To share an existing local session through cmux.cloud without a public listener, run its outbound machine agent separately:

```bash
npx cmux machine-agent --session agents
```

Run this command from an interactive terminal with `/dev/tty`; the agent fails closed without a controlling terminal, including on reconnects. The first registration prints the one-time code used by `+ Connect machine` on cmux.cloud.

## Sessions and sockets

The default socket path is:

```text
$TMPDIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/<session>.sock
```

The usual default is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock` when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set, then `$TMPDIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock`, then `/tmp/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock`. `--session <name>` changes the final file name. `--socket <path>` bypasses the session-derived path. Server-started child processes receive both `CMUX_TUI_SOCKET` and legacy `CMUX_MUX_SOCKET` with the socket path.

## Platforms and XDG

cmux-tui supports macOS and Linux; Windows support via ConPTY is planned for phase 2. The TUI config path resolves `CMUX_TUI_CONFIG`, then legacy `CMUX_MUX_CONFIG`, then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmux/cmux-tui.json` or `~/.config/cmux/cmux-tui.json`. Existing `mux.json` files remain supported and are used when `cmux-tui.json` is absent.

Launched Chrome profile paths are platform-specific. On macOS the default is `~/Library/Application Support/cmux-tui/chrome-profile`. On Linux and other non-macOS targets, `XDG_DATA_HOME` is used when set, then `~/.local/share/cmux-tui/chrome-profile`.

## Development flow

Run tests from `cmux-tui/`.

```bash
cargo test
```

Run the smoke scripts against a built binary. Set `CMUX_TUI_BIN` to test a non-default binary.

```bash
cargo build -p cmux-tui
python3 scripts/smoke-tui.py
python3 scripts/smoke-attach.py
```

This checkout does not contain `scripts/mux-dev.sh`; use the cargo and smoke commands above for the TUI flow.
