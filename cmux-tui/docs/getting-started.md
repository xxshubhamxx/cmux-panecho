# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Builds need zig 0.15.2, a Rust toolchain, and the `ghostty` submodule. `ghostty-vt-sys` compiles `libghostty-vt.a` from that submodule, so an uninitialized submodule fails before the TUI starts.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo build -p cmux-tui
```

## Local session

A normal run starts an in-process mux, opens the TUI, and serves the control socket.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- --session agents
```

The default session is `main`. Quitting a local TUI shuts down that in-process session and removes its socket.

Use `--term <value>` to set `TERM` for child PTYs. Without it, children get `xterm-256color`; the surface layer also honors `CMUX_TUI_TERM` when no CLI value is supplied, with `CMUX_MUX_TERM` retained as a legacy fallback.

## Headless server and attach

Headless mode starts only the mux backend and control socket.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- --headless --session agents
```

Attach a TUI to that session from another terminal.

```bash
cd cmux-tui
cargo run -p cmux-tui -- attach --session agents
```

Detach from an attached TUI with prefix `d`. With default keys, that is `Ctrl-b d`. The server keeps running, and another `attach` reconnects to the same tree. PTY tabs attach with a Ghostty VT-state replay followed by a live output stream.

## Remote machines

The optional machine rail keeps rendering local while it connects individual session transports through Unix sockets or SSH. It is disabled for the default local run and activates when `machine_sidebar.enabled` is true or `machines` contains a valid entry in `cmux-tui.json`. Start a headless cmux session on each remote machine, and make the remote `cmux-tui` or `cmux` executable available to noninteractive SSH. The SSH connector runs its `relay` mode and does not nest a second TUI.

Packaged clients use the same configuration and can start with:

```bash
npx cmux
```

See [Machines](machines.md) for Unix and SSH examples, rail input, and remote setup.

## Sessions and sockets

The default socket path is:

```text
$TMPDIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/<session>.sock
```

The usual default is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock` when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is set, then `$TMPDIR/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock`, then `/tmp/cmux-tui-<uid>/main.sock`. `--session <name>` changes the final file name. `--socket <path>` bypasses the session-derived path. Server-started child processes receive both `CMUX_TUI_SOCKET` and legacy `CMUX_MUX_SOCKET` with the socket path.

## Platforms and XDG

cmux-tui supports macOS and Linux; Windows support via ConPTY is planned for phase 2. The TUI config path resolves `CMUX_TUI_CONFIG`, then legacy `CMUX_MUX_CONFIG`, then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmux/cmux-tui.json` or `~/.config/cmux/cmux-tui.json`. Existing `mux.json` files remain supported and are used when `cmux-tui.json` is absent.

Launched Chrome profile paths are platform-specific. On macOS the default is `~/Library/Application Support/cmux-tui/chrome-profile`. On Linux and other non-macOS targets, `XDG_DATA_HOME` is used when set, then `~/.local/share/cmux-tui/chrome-profile`.

## Development flow

Run tests from `cmux-tui/`.

```bash
cargo test
```

Run the smoke scripts against a built binary. Set `CMUX_TUI_BIN` to test a non-default binary.

```bash
cargo build -p cmux-tui
python3 scripts/smoke-tui.py
python3 scripts/smoke-attach.py
```

This checkout does not contain `scripts/mux-dev.sh`; use the cargo and smoke commands above for the TUI flow.
