## Current reconciliation: main `af31628f7b0b2f6c34e184049254fa2fe91f285d`

Audit basis: 2026-08-27T19:39:39Z. Current merged log: [#10984](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10984)
`e9543607420f7b3b3284ac4c71ea21918dea692e`, [#10975](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10975)
`46958aa58d171a01af7a5b1f06164f18d8639612`, [#10986](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10986)
`b5023a455618dd3d4885da2605e162b0bdb67790`, [#10982](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10982)
`642a65b1512d0d61aaef88290f90ef3408bbee74`, [#10985](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10985)
`2b61ecafceb4b1c008b6f07345270615a0fb4286`, and [#10612](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10612)
`af31628f7b0b2f6c34e184049254fa2fe91f285d`. This is a docs-only update.

Strict auditable session turns are `unknown` (not zero), because no durable
session identifiers were found. The practical floor is five documented
substantive owner workstreams. A branch proxy shows 96 TUI references and 78
substantive non-merge commits; it is not a turn count. Unresolved Claude IDs
are `1787650444261`, `1787650724161` (state ownership, manual I/O, reconnect),
`1787722163382`, `1787723964393` (remove Go daemon, direct tunnels),
`1787733887926`, `1787780735531` (machine terminals, VNC, attach, parity),
`1787794506089` (cloud tree), `1787823710241` (sidebar split),
`1787825896700` (wheel arrows), and `1787826030510` (completion subscriptions).
No transcript proves completion.

No new session scan ran. Retained evidence proves at least 258 named
substantive turns, a lower bound only. No 10,000-session claim is made. Later
code merges require a final refresh.

committed 2026-08-27T05:49:57-07:00 with subject
`Integrate Escape passthrough fix from PR #9810 (#10959)`. The prior
`5c2ee1244e2d796c9e4be5307788b320ac2ee4ff` and earlier
`99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095` snapshots are retained below.
Metadata-only scan: 587 Codex session files dated after the prior snapshot and
2,505 Codex/Claude files mentioning TUI. No transcript values or secrets were
copied. Open dependent intents remain [#10736](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10736) and [#10742](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10742). Cloud resource projection [#10812](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10812) is superseded by merged [#10887](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10887). Packaging duplicate [#10886](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10886) remains open and is superseded pending [#10891](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/10891).

The retained session receipt supports at least 258 named substantive turns.
This is a verifiable lower bound, not a total session count, and no
10,000-session claim is made.

Merged context for the current main tail is recorded here so request status is
not confused with code integration. A merge does not close a request without
behavior evidence.

## Historical snapshot retained: main `5c2ee1244e2d796c9e4be5307788b320ac2ee4ff`

The following request rows and scan receipt preserve the prior snapshot
captured at 2026-08-27T09:54:48Z. They are historical evidence, not a fresh
current-session inventory.

The following request rows and scan receipt preserve the prior snapshot. They
are historical evidence, not a fresh current-session inventory.

Historical snapshot: 2026-08-27T09:25:01Z, pinned to `origin/main`
[`99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/commit/99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095).
Evidence comes from local Codex and Claude session records. A request stays
open until its user-visible behavior has a focused test or a recorded dogfood
result. The previous rows are preserved; this section adds only the current
audit delta.

## Historical 2026-08-27 audit additions at main `99bdc375e98eb9abddd3f54289bc16ef876e8095`

The scan receipt is 174 parsed Claude records and 42 session IDs from
`~/.claude/history.jsonl:90614-end`, plus 47 parsed Codex records and 17 IDs
from `~/.codex/history.jsonl:18787-end`. Only 26 Claude records and two Codex
records matched the selected TUI terms. Credentials, secret values, emails,
pasted payloads, encrypted inter-agent content, and unrelated records were not
copied into this board.

| Two-rail cloud TUI information architecture. | Sessions `01a0025a-cd4e-7100-b313-d1a1bf98a50a` and `01a0132d-85cd-7031-94e5-728512bf833a` | Machine rail lists local and remote hosts with New VM; workspace rail follows selected machine; reorder persists; cross-device attach works. | Open, product and security design |

| Terminal color parity. | Same session `01a003cb-cc3f-7d82-940f-2eda42c167f7` | Compare ANSI palette, truecolor, default colors, OSC overrides, and reconnect against the reference without washed output. | Partial, behavior proof needed |

## Wave-48 pattern notes

Official [Tokio channels](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels),
[`watch`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/watch/),
[`select!`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/macro.select.html),
[Ratatui `Terminal`](https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/struct.Terminal.html),
and [Crossterm events](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/enum.Event.html)
support one state-owner task for typed actions, immutable revisioned snapshots
for derived UI state, and sequenced resize claims. They do not support using a
latest-value watcher for ordered PTY bytes or protocol events. Cancellation must
close admission, stop I/O, release ownership, and join or reap children.

## Current simplification rule

Remove a prompt, duplicate state, or separate command when the same intent can
be expressed by one typed action with a stable result. Keep an extra step only
when it protects authorization, destructive-action safety, or protocol
compatibility. Record that reason beside the action.

## Evidence limits

Session records show intent, not completion. Paths above identify evidence
without copying unrelated private transcript content. The technical-debt board
and changelog record code changes, exact commits, hosted checks, and revert
commands.
