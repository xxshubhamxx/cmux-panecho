# Keyboard

## Prefix Model

`cmux-tui` uses a tmux-style prefix. The default prefix is `Ctrl-b`. After the prefix, the next key is interpreted as a mux command. Pressing the prefix twice sends a literal `Ctrl-b` to the active surface.

Unknown prefixed keys are swallowed. Unprefixed non-Alt keys go to the active surface. Alt chords that are bound in the key table are modeless commands by default.

## Default Bindings

These defaults come from `Keys::default`.

| Binding | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl-b t` | New PTY tab in the active pane |
| `Alt-t` | New PTY tab in the active pane |
| `Ctrl-b B` | Open the browser-tab URL prompt |
| `Alt-n` | Create a pane with Zellij's default vertical auto-layout |
| `Ctrl-b Tab` | Next tab in the active pane |
| `Ctrl-b BackTab` | Previous tab in the active pane |
| `Ctrl-b 0` through `Ctrl-b 9` | Select visible screen 0 through 9 |
| `Ctrl-b %` | Split the active pane right |
| `Ctrl-b "` | Split the active pane down |
| `Ctrl-b x` | Close the active pane |
| `Ctrl-b X` | Close the active tab |
| `Ctrl-b ,` | Rename the active screen |
| `Ctrl-b $` | Rename the active workspace |
| `Ctrl-b &` | Close the active screen |
| `Ctrl-b p` | Previous screen in the active workspace |
| `Alt-[` | Previous screen in the active workspace |
| `Ctrl-b n` | Next screen in the active workspace |
| `Alt-]` | Next screen in the active workspace |
| `Ctrl-b c` | New screen in the active workspace |
| `Ctrl-b z` | Toggle zoom for the active pane |
| `Ctrl-b o` | Focus the next pane in the current screen |
| `Ctrl-b {` | Swap the active pane with the previous pane |
| `Ctrl-b }` | Swap the active pane with the next pane |
| `Ctrl-b w` | Next workspace |
| `Ctrl-b W` | New workspace |
| `Ctrl-b s` | Show or hide the sidebar |
| `Ctrl-b e` | Toggle the built-in sidebar between files and workspaces |
| `Ctrl-b S` | Focus the built-in sidebar or configured sidebar plugin; a prefixed command returns focus to the pane |
| `Ctrl-b h` or `Ctrl-b Left` | Focus left |
| `Alt-h` or `Alt-Left` | Focus left |
| `Ctrl-b l` or `Ctrl-b Right` | Focus right |
| `Alt-l` or `Alt-Right` | Focus right |
| `Ctrl-b k` or `Ctrl-b Up` | Focus up |
| `Alt-k` or `Alt-Up` | Focus up |
| `Ctrl-b j` or `Ctrl-b Down` | Focus down |
| `Alt-j` or `Alt-Down` | Focus down |
| `Alt-=` | Grow the focused split |
| `Alt--` | Shrink the focused split |
| `Ctrl-b [` | Scroll the active PTY viewport up 10 rows |
| `Ctrl-b PageUp` | Scroll the active PTY viewport up 10 rows |
| `Ctrl-b PageDown` | Scroll the active PTY viewport down 10 rows |
| `Ctrl-b d` | Quit a local TUI or detach an attached TUI |

Directional focus follows Zellij's pane memory: when several panes share the requested edge, cmux-tui returns to the pane focused most recently.

The screen bindings intentionally match tmux: `c` creates a screen, `n` and `p` switch screens, `&` closes a screen, `,` renames a screen, `z` zooms a pane, `o` cycles panes, `{` and `}` swap panes, and number keys select visible screens. Screens are numbered from 0, so `Ctrl-b 0` selects screen 0 and `Ctrl-b 1` selects screen 1.

`Ctrl-b x` now follows tmux and closes the active pane. `Ctrl-b X` closes the active tab. Restore the old cmux behavior with `"close-tab": "x"` and `"close-pane": "X"` in `cmux-tui.json`.

`Ctrl-b ]` is unbound because cmux has no paste-buffer concept. `Ctrl-b q` is unbound because there is no pane-number quick-jump overlay yet.

## Focused Sidebar

When the built-in sidebar is focused, `Tab` toggles files/workspaces without leaving sidebar focus. In the files view, Up/Down and Ctrl-J/Ctrl-K move the selection, Right descends into a directory, Enter descends or opens a file in a new `$EDITOR` tab, and Left or `h` goes to the parent when the machine rail is absent. `c` sends a safely quoted `cd` to the focused pane, `o` opens `.html` and `.md` files in a browser tab, `.` toggles dotfiles, `/` enters filter mode, and `~` follows the focused pane cwd again. Esc clears a nonempty filter before leaving filter mode.

In the workspaces view, Up/Down move the selection and Enter activates it. Any normal prefixed command leaves sidebar focus and runs through the usual action table; `prefix S` only returns focus to the pane. A configured sidebar plugin keeps its existing PTY forwarding behavior.

When the optional machine rail is visible, `Ctrl-b S` still enters through the workspace rail. From the built-in workspace or files rail, Left or `h` moves focus to the machine rail. From the machine rail, Right or `l` returns to the workspace rail. Up/Down or `k`/`j` changes the selected machine, Enter connects to it, and Esc returns to the active pane. A mouse click can focus either rail directly. The machine rail swallows other unprefixed keys instead of forwarding them to a remote terminal.

## Modeless Alt Layer

Any configured Alt chord is active without the prefix. Default modeless commands are `Alt-t`, `Alt-n`, `Alt-[`, `Alt-]`, `Alt-h/j/k/l`, Alt arrows, `Alt-=`, and `Alt--`. `Alt-n` follows Zellij's default auto-layout sequence: one full-height left pane and up to four right-side rows, balanced columns of four through twelve panes, then one full-height left pane beside a right-side stack with the focused stack pane expanded.

Set `keys.alt_shortcuts` to `false` to remove the default Alt bindings. This kill switch only removes defaults; Alt chords explicitly configured in `cmux-tui.json` still work.

Zellij's modal `ctrl+p`, `ctrl+t`, `ctrl+s`, `ctrl+n`, and `ctrl+o` modes are a deliberate non-goal because they conflict with common shell and editor control keys such as history, transpose, flow control, and editor navigation.

## Number Selection

`0` through `9` are regular configurable screen-selection bindings. Zero-based tab selectors are available as `select-tab-0` through `select-tab-9`; they are unbound by default because the number keys select screens.

## Remapping

Keys are read from `~/.config/cmux/cmux-tui.json`, with legacy `mux.json` used when the new file is absent. `CMUX_TUI_CONFIG` overrides the path; `CMUX_MUX_CONFIG` remains as a legacy fallback.

Each action accepts a string, an array of strings, or `"none"`. Setting an action replaces all default chords for that action before adding the configured chords. `"none"` leaves the action unbound.

```json
{
  "keys": {
    "prefix": "ctrl+a",
    "alt_shortcuts": false,
    "new-tab": ["t", "alt+t"],
    "new-pane-smart": "alt+n",
    "select-screen-0": "0",
    "select-screen-1": "1",
    "next-screen": ["n", "alt+]"],
    "prev-screen": ["p", "alt+["],
    "focus-left": ["h", "left", "alt+h", "alt+left"],
    "rename-tab": "r",
    "rename-screen": ",",
    "close-pane": "x",
    "close-tab": "X",
    "select-tab-0": "none"
  }
}
```

Supported action keys are:

```text

select-tab-0
select-tab-1
select-tab-2
select-tab-3

detach
```

`rename-pane` is still accepted as an alias for `rename-tab`.

## Chord Format

Chord strings are case-sensitive for single characters. Uppercase letters and symbols represent the shifted character.

Supported examples include `"c"`, `"%"`, `"ctrl+b"`, `"alt+enter"`, `"tab"`, `"backtab"`, `"shift+tab"`, `"pageup"`, `"pagedown"`, `"esc"`, `"space"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"up"`, `"down"`, `"home"`, and `"end"`.
