# Mouse

## Click Targets

The files sidebar view (`sidebar.view = "files"`) shows the focused pane's cwd, one row per directory/file, and a count or filter footer. A single click selects a file row. Crossterm's mouse events do not expose an existing double-click concept here, so clicks do not open or descend; use Enter or Right while the sidebar is focused. Toggle to the workspaces view with focused-sidebar `Tab` or the `toggle-sidebar-view` action.

The workspaces view shows two rows per workspace and `+ new workspace`, with no header row. Click either row of a workspace to select it. Click `+ new workspace` to create one. Its terminal-style scrollbar appears one column inside the resize divider only when workspace rows overflow. Wheel over the rail, click the scrollbar's invisible track, or drag its thumb to scroll the workspace list. Drag the sidebar's right border in either built-in view to set a session-local width override. Configured `sidebar.max_width` limits the drag width when it is greater than zero, and the TUI still leaves at least 40 columns for panes.

When configured, the machine rail uses the same two-line entry, active marker, and selected-row treatment as the built-in workspace list (rails have no header row; the one-row pad at a rail's top focuses it without activating a row, and every rail leads with its `+` action rows at the bottom). Press a non-active machine entry to connect to it. Click `+ ssh host` to open the native SSH host picker, then filter a discovered alias or choose `Add SSH host…` for a process-local target. Provider-owned connection flows may use the same row for a host address or pairing code. Click `+ new vm` to run a provider create action or choose among configured prototype sources; right-click it (or the machine rail's top pad, when create is unavailable) for provider scope switching and provider actions. The prototype picker adds only a local catalog row and never invokes Docker or a cloud API.

An ordered `tabs` column shows every tab in the highlighted workspace. Clicking a row activates its workspace, screen, pane, and tab. Wheel input scrolls long tab lists. Drag any native column's right divider to set its independent session-local width.

Each pane has a border box. Click inside a pane to focus it. The top border is the tab bar: click a tab chip to select it, click `+` to create a PTY tab, click `‹` or `›` to scroll overflowing tabs, or wheel over the bar to scroll tab chips while keeping the active tab visible.

The status bar lists screens for the active workspace. Click a screen segment to select it. Click the trailing `+` to create a screen.

When a screen overflows horizontally, the open space in the status bar becomes a continuous viewport track. Click it to animate to that position, or drag it for direct movement. Horizontal wheel events over the pane region pan by one sixth of the viewport. Screens without horizontal overflow continue forwarding those events to the active surface.

Every native sidebar row activates on left press. Workspace presses also arm
the rendered stable identity for reorder, while release only finishes that
gesture. Pane tab chips still arm their rendered stable identity on press and
activate or move it on release. A release without a corresponding armed press
is a no-op; it cannot select whichever workspace or tab later occupies that
coordinate.

## Drag Reorder

Drag a tab chip to reorder it within the same pane. Drag it to another pane's tab bar to move the tab across panes. The dragged tab is dimmed, and the target insertion point is shown with a `▌` marker.

In the workspaces view, drag a workspace entry to reorder workspaces. The drop position is shown with a horizontal `─` marker.

## Scrollbars

The scrollbar is visible only when a PTY surface can scroll. With the default `scrollbar.position = "column"`, it uses a dedicated column just inside the right border. With `"border"`, it overlays the right border.

Pane, workspace, and shortcut-modal scrollbars share one style. The thumb is `▕` normally and `▐` while hovered or dragged; no scrollbar is drawn when all rows fit. Clicking the thumb starts a drag without moving the viewport. Clicking the invisible track outside the thumb jumps to that relative position, then starts a drag from the clicked anchor.

Wheel over a PTY pane focuses that pane first. When the inner app enables terminal mouse tracking, wheel events are forwarded at the pointer position using the app's requested mouse protocol. Otherwise, the normal screen scrolls by three rows and the alternate screen receives three up or down arrow keys.

## Resize

Drag pane borders to resize the matching split. Dragging a corner adjusts both intersecting split axes. Ordinary split ratios are clamped from 0.05 to 0.95. Outer edges that do not correspond to a split do not change layout.

On a horizontally scrollable screen, drag either side of a column divider to resize the column on its left. Drag the final column's right border to resize that column. Column widths are clamped from one tenth through one full viewport. Splits inside each column remain independently resizable. One continuous divider drag is coalesced into one `Ctrl-b U` layout-undo entry.

Drag a rail border to resize that rail for the current TUI session. Dragging the workspace rail leaves compact mode and sets its full-width override. `sidebar.views` supplies base widths, maximum widths, and collapse priorities; legacy layouts still use `machine_sidebar.width`, `sidebar.width`, and `sidebar.compact_width`. Resizing one view preserves every other visible view while leaving at least 40 columns for panes.

## Context Menus

Right-click a pane for rename tab, close tab, new pane, new tab, new browser tab, browser actions when applicable, split right, split down, close pane, maximize/restore, and ID copying. New pane runs the same smart-layout action as `Alt-n`. Every right-click menu, including blank status-bar space, contains Show/Hide Sidebar. When an inner PTY app enables mouse tracking, right-click is forwarded to the app; hold Shift while right-clicking to open the cmux menu.

Right-click anywhere inside the sidebar, including its top pad, empty space, file rows, projected tree rows, and divider, for show/hide, compact/full, and focus actions. Workspace rows also include rename, close, and copy-ID actions. Tab and agent rows rename the exact surface represented by that row. Switching between files and workspaces remains a keyboard action (`Ctrl-b e` by default) and is not in the context menu. Right-click a status-bar screen for its screen actions plus Show/Hide Sidebar.

Each context menu includes Keyboard shortcuts, which opens the same modal as `Ctrl-b ?`. The modal has a visible `[Esc close]` button and a terminal-style scrollbar when its rows overflow, with wheel, track-click, and thumb-drag control. Every menu action with a configured key shows the resolved shortcut on the right. Remapped prefix and action keys appear immediately, and unbound actions omit the shortcut.

Menus draw bordered overlays. Divider rows collapse as needed to keep every action visible when the flat menu would fit. When rows overflow, the menu draws the shared native scrollbar and supports wheel, track click, and thumb drag. Up and Down move the selected row, Home and End jump to the first and last action, Enter activates it, and Esc closes the menu. A right press, drag to a row, and release activates that row. A plain right-click opens the menu and leaves it open.

## Selection and Clipboard

Clicks, releases, and motion inside a PTY pane are forwarded when the inner app enables terminal mouse tracking. cmux uses Ghostty's encoder so X10, UTF-8, SGR, URxvt, and SGR pixel modes follow the app's terminal state. Hold Shift to bypass mouse reporting and use cmux text selection.

Drag inside a PTY pane to select text when mouse tracking is disabled or Shift is held. Releasing copies non-empty selected text to the host clipboard with OSC 52. The selection stores absolute scrollback rows, so it remains stable while the viewport scrolls.

Holding a selection drag at the top or bottom content edge auto-scrolls and extends the selection. Typing clears the selection. If the selected surface exits, the selection is cleared.

Browser panes receive left press, drag, and release as CDP mouse events instead of starting text selection.

## Pointer Shape

The TUI emits OSC 22 `pointer` over clickable UI and OSC 22 `default` elsewhere. Terminals without pointer-shape support ignore it.

## Text Input Dialogs

Rename, connect-machine, and browser URL prompts are centered bordered dialogs using the same `TextInput` editor. Buttons are labeled with shortcuts: `[ Clear ^C ]`, `[ Cancel esc ]`, and `[ OK ⏎ ]`.

Enter commits. Esc cancels. Ctrl-C clears. Home and Ctrl-A move to the start. End and Ctrl-E move to the end. Alt-Left and Alt-B move one word left. Alt-Right and Alt-F move one word right. Backspace deletes left, Delete and Ctrl-D delete right, Ctrl-W and Alt-Backspace delete a word left, Alt-D deletes a word right, Ctrl-K deletes to the end, and Ctrl-U deletes to the start.

Click OK to commit, Clear to clear, Cancel or outside the dialog to close, and the input row to move the cursor. Right-clicking while a prompt is open shakes the dialog instead of opening a menu.
