# cmux-tui docs

`cmux-tui` is a terminal multiplexer backed by Ghostty's VT engine. PTY output becomes styled terminal state that the TUI, public resource streams, and other frontends can render consistently.

## Contents

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): build prerequisites, local and headless runs, sockets, detach and attach, session isolation for products built on cmux-tui.
- [Concepts](concepts.md): session tree, focus, collapse behavior, tab naming, smart split, terminals, and browsers.
- [Keyboard](keyboard.md): prefix model, modeless Alt layer, default bindings, and `cmux-tui.json` key remapping.

- [Raw control protocol](protocol.md): private protocol-v12 JSON-lines commands for cmux frontends and compatibility adapters.
- [Public CLI](../spec/cli.md): noun-first commands and selectors.
- [SDK contract](../spec/bindings.md): handwritten facades and generated raw layers.
