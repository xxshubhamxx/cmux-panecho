//! seen in the TUI survive the session and can be diagnosed later. The file
//! is size-bounded: when the active file passes [`MAX_ACTIVE_BYTES`] it is
//! renamed to `<name>.1` (replacing the previous rollover), so disk usage
//! never exceeds two files.
//!
//! Location: `platform::client_log_path()` — the cmux-tui state root, or the
//! `CMUX_TUI_LOG_FILE` override. Logging is best-effort and silent: a client
//! must never fail or spam the terminal because its log file is unavailable.
