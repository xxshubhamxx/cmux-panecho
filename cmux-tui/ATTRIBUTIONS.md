  Copilot background-agent activity `2290257acb2085ce6842ba5c7e3ca50c3ba64f02`.

Derived material and vendored material:

- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/manifests/*.toml`: 19
  manifests are unchanged from the manifest snapshot's
  `src/detect/manifests/`; `claude.toml` is byte-identical to upstream commit
  `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`. `grok.toml` carries the one
  documented cmux correction; `github-copilot.toml` is byte-identical to the
  upstream snapshot. Never refresh these files from herdr's update endpoint.
  Re-vendor the 19 files from the exact snapshot, take Claude from its stated
  commit, and reapply the Grok correction when changing the pin.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/src/manifest.rs`: the
  manifest engine (rule grammar, region extraction, gate evaluation,
  validation limits), ported from `src/detect/manifest.rs`.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/src/{detect.rs,scanner.rs}`:
  detection semantics (state model, edge-triggered transitions,
  foreground-process identification, quiescence sampling) derived from
  `src/detect/mod.rs`, `src/pane/agent_detection.rs`, and `src/pane.rs`.
  These files are a userland plugin. Herdr's first-acquisition OSC retention
  fix (`82e6a80eb3ae39fb3d3ebd4d1fed19389767e605`) is adapted as a local
  output-revision fence for replacement agents. Core only supervises the
  process and folds its generic events.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/src/process.rs`: bounded
  foreground process-group discovery and wrapper handling derived from
  herdr's platform and detector modules, with platform fallbacks, stricter
  candidate filtering, attached runtime-mode parsing, positional-argument
  boundaries, direct shell-script parsing, shell-word unescaping, runtime-specific
  shell invocation-mode checks, Python boolean/exit/value option boundaries,
  attached-versus-separate option handling, and bounded `/proc` streaming added
  by manaflow. The Python distinctions are
  a local correctness improvement over the inherited option list: `-S` is
  boolean, documented help aliases (`-?`, `-VV`) terminate, and
  help/version/hash options cannot expose following tokens as agent
  executables. Unsupported attached long options fail closed before they can
  consume a later runtime mode flag.
- `crates/cmux-tui-core/src/terminal_metadata.rs`: OSC string framing adapted
  from herdr's `src/pane/osc.rs`. Manaflow adds lead-specific UTF-8
  continuation validation and malformed-sequence recovery before C1 framing.
  Core retains only generic bounded OSC 9 progress metadata; it has no agent
  or roster policy.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/src/manifest_update.rs`:
  explicit catalog and cache status concepts derived from herdr's update
  surface. Network access, URL validation, atomic writes, and version policy
  are a new manaflow implementation and never run during daemon startup.
- `crates/cmux-tui/src/sidebar_projection.rs` (`agent_attention`) and the
  agents-view rendering in `crates/cmux-tui/src/ui/{sidebar.rs,rail.rs}`:
  the two-line row and header layout follow `src/app/agent_view.rs` and
  herdr's agents-panel design. cmux currently orders rows by blocked,
  working, then idle, with newest transitions first inside each bucket. The
  cache invalidation against cmux's terminal topology and the stable
  tree-order tie break are manaflow additions. The herdr idle-unseen seen bit
  is intentionally not copied because it is client-owned presentation state;
  the deliberate exclusion is listed in `spec/plugins.md`.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/manifests/grok.toml`: the
  local `2026.07.16.2.1` patch gives idle OSC progress precedence over a
  generic custom title, keeps explicit braille-spinner activity stronger, and
  excludes the blank braille code point from that activity rule.
- `bindings/examples/rust-agent-screen-detection/manifests/claude.toml`: the
  upstream `2026.08.31.1` file removes background-shell activity as a working
  signal, so an idle prompt or a permission blocker stays authoritative.
- The plugin's `manifests/SHA256SUMS` record is checked before bundled
  compilation to catch accidental drift. It is not a cryptographic release
  signature for remote updates.

The capability audit was rerun against herdr's agent-surface revision
`987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`. Comparing `src/detect` with the
manifest snapshot found the exact Pi bundled CLI path correction from
`b1ff4582e9688f52ffb943cfa8bee4871ae122e4` and the Claude background-shell
manifest correction from `987b070fbfa187e85009b45cd7e208fc6175ff6a`.
The userland package ports and tests both. The `process.rs` adaptation covers
both direct and `dist/bundle/cli.js` entrypoints and rejects lookalike scripts.
The first-acquisition OSC retention fix in
`82e6a80eb3ae39fb3d3ebd4d1fed19389767e605` is adapted in the userland tracker
with a local revision fence. The foreground group-leader CWD fix in
`3a3792622e59c7f2dc20f9c0236167161e4a5035` is already covered by the generic
`foreground_cwd` resource, so no herdr-specific CWD policy is copied.

The shell-render refactor in `207be3c771d281baae6e5fa0fb74be9a056e97a2` and
independent multi-client tab views in
`6c0bb273d5d5405a00985621b17e36f8b4d64609` are application/client architecture,
not detector behavior. The latest delayed-agent-prompt fix in
`8633a398e653eee47b375c963996c78a8a14aa48` changes PTY input sequencing, and
`5616196942cbe752cc0659b9bd0fb616b2a6ed5c` hardens malformed Windows process
environments in portable-pty. The later generic terminal-read fix
`45484aab84430ac2b18c7bbf44aba15f2b039677`, graphics ownership fix
`e22cba35ef7b405758097a5f9436aae8fb4caaf0`, Windows input fix
`2ae8b91ca5919c26df7ce779b0e9a5dd98b769ae`, and sidebar-focus fix
`94f6d9c0d9bb9cf9ffae99d8bbfb09e9bf2fc9e0` are also outside detector
behavior. These changes are not copied. If cmux needs atomic text-plus-Enter
submission, that belongs in a separate generic terminal-input contract, not in
a detector or an agent-specific core method. A standalone release must define
and test SDK endpoint-generation compatibility before it promises binary
upgrades across host versions. Review the Windows changes before publishing a
Windows package.

The herdr repository tip checked on 2026-09-02 is
`94f6d9c0d9bb9cf9ffae99d8bbfb09e9bf2fc9e0`. The commits after the
agent-surface revision change client rendering, terminal reads, graphics,
Windows input and worktree handling, or sidebar focus. They do not change
`src/detect` or the manifests. The agent-surface revision is therefore the
reproducible capability-audit pin.

Files that port herdr logic carry a header comment naming the upstream
file and the modifications.
