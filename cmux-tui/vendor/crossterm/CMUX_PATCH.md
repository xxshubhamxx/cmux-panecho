# cmux Crossterm patch

This directory vendors Crossterm 0.29.0. cmux enables Kitty keyboard protocol
flags 4 and 16, but upstream 0.29.0 discards the reported shifted key,
PC-101-layout key, and associated text while parsing CSI-u events.

The cmux patch adds `EnhancedKeyEvent`, preserves those fields in the Unix
parser, and keeps the original `KeyEvent` identity and modifiers intact. Remove
the patch when [crossterm-rs/crossterm#968](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/968)
ships in the Crossterm version used by cmux.
