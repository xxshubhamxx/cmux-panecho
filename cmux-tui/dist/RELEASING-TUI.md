# cmux TUI Distribution Release

The cmux TUI distribution uses `cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` tags. The npm launcher
package, npm platform packages, and PyPI wheels all share the same `X.Y.Z`
version for a release.

TUI distribution versions are independent of the SDK version. SDKs publish as
`cmux-sdk` on npm and PyPI, so the `cmux` name remains exclusive to this TUI
release path.

The TUI does not store its version in a checked-in manifest. The packaging
scripts receive `--version`, so cutting a stable TUI release is just creating a
`cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` tag on `main`.

## Packages

- npm `cmux`: launcher package for `npx cmux`.
- npm `cmux-tui-darwin-arm64`: macOS arm64 binary package.
- npm `cmux-tui-darwin-x64`: macOS x64 binary package.
- npm `cmux-tui-linux-x64`: Linux x64 binary package.
- npm `cmux-tui-linux-arm64`: Linux arm64 binary package.
- PyPI `cmux`: platform wheels for `uvx cmux` / `pipx run cmux`.

Linux packages contain static musl binaries that run on both glibc and musl
distributions. PyPI publishes each Linux binary under matching manylinux and
musllinux wheel tags so installers on both runtime families can resolve it.

## One-time registry setup

Add npm Trusted Publishers for all five npm package names:

- `cmux`
- `cmux-tui-darwin-arm64`
- `cmux-tui-darwin-x64`
- `cmux-tui-linux-x64`
- `cmux-tui-linux-arm64`

Use these npm trusted-publisher settings for each package:

- Repository: `manaflow-ai/cmux`
- Workflow: `tui-publish-npm.yml`
- Environment: `npm-tui`

Add a PyPI Trusted Publisher for:

- Project: `cmux`
- Repository: `manaflow-ai/cmux`
- Workflow: `tui-publish-pypi.yml`
- Environment: `pypi-tui`

Nightly publishing uses the same environments. Add trusted publishers for:

- npm packages:
  - Repository: `manaflow-ai/cmux`
  - Workflow: `cmux-tui-nightly.yml`
  - Environment: `npm-tui`
- PyPI project `cmux`:
  - Repository: `manaflow-ai/cmux`
  - Workflow: `cmux-tui-nightly.yml`
  - Environment: `pypi-tui`

## Nightly channel

`.github/workflows/cmux-tui-nightly.yml` runs on a daily schedule and by manual
dispatch. It always checks out `main`, derives the next stable version from the
latest reachable `cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` tag by bumping patch, and falls back to
`0.9.0` when no stable TUI tag exists.

Nightly versions use registry-specific prerelease forms:

- npm: `<next-stable>-nightly.<YYYYMMDD>.<run-number>`, for example
  `0.9.1-nightly.20260708.1`.
- PyPI: `<next-stable>.dev<YYYYMMDD><run-number>`, for example
  `0.9.1.dev202607081`.

npm nightlies are published with `npm publish --provenance --tag nightly`, so
`npx cmux@nightly` opts into the latest nightly and `npx cmux` remains on the
stable `latest` dist-tag. PyPI nightlies are dev releases, so normal
`uvx cmux` resolution ignores them; `uvx --prerelease allow cmux` opts in.

The nightly workflow intentionally always builds and publishes a fresh run
instead of trying to skip when `main` has not changed. The build is cheap, and a
GitHub API lookup for the last successful nightly is more fragile than the
extra build.

## Cutting a Stable Release

Use `.github/workflows/cmux-tui-release-cut.yml` from `main`.

- Select `patch`, `minor`, or `major`, or provide an explicit `X.Y.Z` version.
- The workflow reads the latest reachable `cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` tag, validates the
  new version is strictly greater, creates annotated tag `cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` on
  `main` HEAD, and pushes that tag.
- The tag is pushed with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub suppresses
  workflow triggers for token-created events, so the release-cut workflow then
  explicitly dispatches `cmux-tui-release.yml` against the new tag with npm and
  PyPI publishing enabled.
- `cmux-tui-release.yml` builds every target once, creates both registries'
  packages, and runs the Linux compatibility matrix. After those jobs pass, it
  dispatches both top-level publishers with its own artifact run ID. This keeps
  the configured trusted-publisher identities while avoiding registry-specific
  rebuilds.
- A manual `git push origin cmux-tui-vX.Y.Z` runs the artifact workflow without
  publishing. Use the release-cut workflow for a coordinated stable release.

## Publishing

Both registry workflows are manual-dispatch only. They require the ID of a
successful `cmux-tui-release.yml` run on the exact release tag. Each publisher
checks the source workflow, tag, commit, and conclusion before downloading its
package artifact. It never rebuilds the binaries. This also lets a failed
publisher retry reuse the already verified artifacts.

npm additionally requires `confirm_tui_cmux=true`. The platform packages are
published first, then the `cmux` launcher.

The shared artifact run exercises the generated npm and PyPI entrypoints across
the supported glibc and musl distribution matrix on x86_64 and ARM64. A
compatibility regression therefore blocks both registry dispatches.

The npm launcher publish deliberately does not pass `--tag`: when the TUI
version is greater than `0.8.3`, this coordinated release takes over the npm
`latest` dist-tag for `cmux` from the old CLI package.
