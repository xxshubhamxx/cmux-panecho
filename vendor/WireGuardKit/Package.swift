//
// WireGuardKit is the Swift adapter between an `NEPacketTunnelProvider` and the
// wireguard-go userspace implementation. The Go half is not built by SwiftPM:
// `WireGuardKitGo` only publishes `wireguard.h` and asks the linker for
// `libwg-go.a`, which the consuming Xcode target produces with
// `scripts/build-wireguard-go.sh` into its BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR.
