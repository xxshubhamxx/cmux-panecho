# cmux Custom Review Rules

Apply the custom lint rules in `.github/review-bot-rules/` to Swift, runtime, and project changes.

Greptile should treat the rules in that directory as the source of truth for cmux reviews. PR-head edits to the rule files should not weaken review behavior until the edits are merged into the base branch.

Review production Swift and runtime changes for:

- Swift actor isolation mistakes.
- Blocking runtime primitives and timing-based synchronization.
- Browser socket automation commands that wait on WebKit/page callbacks from main actor paths instead of the socket worker.
- Fixed sleeps, delays, and polling used as hacky synchronization.
- Legacy concurrency patterns where Swift concurrency is available.
- Incorrect `@concurrent` or `nonisolated async` behavior.
- Missing SwiftPM package boundaries for independently testable feature logic.
- Production logging that bypasses unified logging or leaks sensitive data.
- User-facing text that is not fully internationalized across every supported app or web locale.
- SwiftUI state and layout patterns that cause stale state, broad invalidation, or render-time mutation.
- Architectural fixes that patch symptoms while leaving bad state representable.
- User-facing errors, alerts, command output, API error bodies, and recovery copy that expose implementation details.
- Algorithmic complexity regressions on scalable user-owned collections.
- Expensive synchronous agent-history disk, JSON, transcript, trajectory, JSONL, directory, or syscall loads (such as `RestorableAgentSessionIndex.load()`, hook/session stores, `agent-turn-diff-baselines.json`, transcripts, trajectory files, and workstream/event logs) on the main actor or interactive paths instead of an off-main cached/background accessor.
- Substituting a cached value for a fresh authoritative read in persistence/history/undo paths without handling cold and stale caches.
- Local/generated artifacts, dependency checkouts, caches, logs, screenshots, temp folders, and scratch directories that accidentally enter source control.
- SwiftPM dependency changes that ignore or omit cmux-owned `Package.resolved` lockfiles.
- Test-only or debug-only seams added to production Swift `Sources/` that should live in the test target or a dedicated debug folder.
- Ambient global state: top-level free functions, global mutable vars, static-only namespace types, and new singletons that should be owned by a scoped type and injected.
- Per-call allocating formatting (`String(format:)`, per-call formatters) on hot or concurrent paths instead of preallocated buffers or reused formatters.
- Correctness-critical detection/identity derived from title/name heuristics or unreliable fallbacks instead of a single reliable source of truth.
- Custom React composite UI built from raw elements when Base UI or an existing local component should own accessibility, focus, and keyboard behavior.

## Runtime No Hacky Sleeps

For production non-Swift app/runtime code and build/runtime scripts, flag fixed sleeps, delayed dispatch, timers, polling, or wall-clock waits used as synchronization.

Fail race repairs for lifecycle, focus, rendering, socket, process, filesystem, network, teardown, startup, retry, or shared-state readiness unless they use a real signal from the owning subsystem or a dedicated cancellation-aware timeout/retry abstraction with tests.

Pass for deterministic test-only scaffolding, GitHub Actions workflow or action YAML sleeps used only for CI orchestration, pure presentation animation or progress timing, and existing delay code the PR does not introduce or worsen. Swift sleeps are covered by the Swift blocking runtime rule.

## Browser Automation WebKit Waits Off Main

For browser socket automation in `Sources/TerminalController.swift` and the cmux control socket policy, keep blocking waits off the main actor.

Flag any `browser.*` command that waits on page JavaScript, WebKit callbacks, `WKHTTPCookieStore`, screenshot callbacks, or injected page hooks while routed through `.mainActor` or the main `processV2Command` switch. Require the command to be listed in `ControlCommandExecutionPolicy.socketWorkerMethods`, dispatched by the worker browser automation router, and covered by policy tests that prove worker routing.

Worker-lane handlers may resolve panels, access WebKit/AppKit, or mutate browser state only inside explicit main hops such as `v2BrowserWithPanelContext` and `v2MainSync`. Pass for direct focus/show commands that do not wait, and for existing debt that the PR does not worsen.

## Full Internationalization

For production user-facing text, require complete internationalization across every locale supported by the affected surface.

Flag Swift UI, menu, alert, tooltip, error, recovery, or command text that is not routed through `String(localized:defaultValue:)` or an equivalent localized API with a matching translated string-catalog entry. Flag app string catalog or Info.plist additions and edits that do not include translated entries for every locale already supported by the touched catalog. Flag web UI text, API response copy, user-facing web data, metadata, route copy, rendered markdown, changelog copy, or message keys that are not consumed from `next-intl` or another locale-specific source and represented across all locales in `web/i18n/routing.ts` and every matching file in `web/messages/`.

Pass for tests, operational docs not shown to end users, developer-only comments, debug-only logs, exact protocol/config tokens, and existing untranslated strings the PR does not introduce or worsen.

## User-Facing Error Messages

For production user-facing errors, alerts, command output, API error bodies, and recovery copy, do not expose implementation details.

Flag copy that includes upstream vendor or service names, internal provider names, provider-specific flags, templates, snapshots, manifests, environment variable names, database or migration details, raw upstream error messages, stack traces, request ids from third-party systems unless the user supplied that exact id, billing item ids, billing customer ids, team ids not supplied by the user, credentials, tokens, headers, private keys, refresh tokens, session ids, or unredacted payload dumps.

Error copy should say what happened in cmux terms, provide concrete user actionables, and keep only safe minimal diagnostics in `details`. Provider, billing, database, and auth implementation details belong in sanitized logs or internal telemetry.

## Algorithmic Complexity

For production code over scalable user-owned collections, flag nested full-collection scans, per-target rescans for batch actions, repeated sort/filter/map work in hot UI/socket/search/process paths, in-memory joins that belong in the data store, and unbenchmarked slower algorithms for paths expected to handle about 1000 workspaces or similar records.

Pass for tiny fixed-size collections, tests, benchmark harnesses, existing inefficient code not worsened by the PR, and documented bounds backed by measurements.

## Swift Expensive Synchronous Agent Loads

For production Swift, flag any unbounded agent-history read, decode, parse, directory scan, or per-record syscall that can run on MainActor or from user-input paths.

Fail synchronous `Data(contentsOf:)`, `String(contentsOf:)`, `JSONSerialization.jsonObject`, `JSONDecoder.decode`, JSONL line scans, transcript/trajectory parsing, `agent-turn-diff-baselines.json` scans, hook/session-store reads, workstream/event log scans, or per-record `fileExists`/stat/sysctl loops when they run in workspace/panel/tab/window close, SwiftUI body/didSet, menu/command-palette/shortcut evaluation, socket handlers, or any immediate UI interaction. These files can grow with all agent history and have caused UI hangs on real machines.

Require `SharedLiveAgentIndex.shared`, a `Task.detached` parser, a background actor/repository, or another off-main cached path that returns to MainActor only for UI/process launch work. Bound scans by focused workspace/surface/session as early as practical. Pass for the cache/background loader itself, explicit nil-cache fallbacks with a justification, and existing call sites the PR does not worsen.

## Source Control Artifacts

For every changed path, flag local tool output, generated logs, screenshots, recordings, temp folders, dependency checkouts, caches, build output, DerivedData, package-manager downloads, and broad scratch directories that enter source control without a deliberate product, docs, fixture, build, release, or test-system reason.

Pass for intentional source files, configs, localization catalogs, review rules, durable docs assets, required fixtures, generated files that are already part of the repo's source-of-truth model, and PRs that only remove or ignore existing accidental artifacts.

## No Test or Debug Seam in Production Source

For Swift files under a production `Sources/` path (matching `**/Sources/**` and not under `**/Tests/**`), flag added test-only or debug-only seams.

Fail a `#if DEBUG` (or other test-build-guarded) extension or member that exposes internal/private state for tests or a debugger with no production caller, a member named like `debug…`/`…ForTesting`/`…ForTests`/`testOnly…`/`…TestHook`/`…TestSeam`/`_test…`, or visibility widened together with a wrapper accessor added so a test can call it. The compiled-out `#if DEBUG` guard does not make a test-observability accessor acceptable in shipping source.

Prefer observing internal state from the test target via `@testable import` after widening `private` to `internal`, or isolating a genuinely debug-only facility in a dedicated debug file or folder. The canonical fix is cmux PR https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/6452, which removed the `#if DEBUG debugQueuedRequestCount()` accessor, widened the queue state to `internal`, and read it from the test target.

Pass for `#if DEBUG` blocks that gate real product behavior, scaffolding inside `Tests/` or a test-support module, and existing seams the PR does not introduce or worsen.

## SwiftPM Package.resolved

For SwiftPM package, Xcode project, `.gitignore`, workflow, and dependency changes, flag cmux-owned package `.gitignore` files that ignore `Package.resolved`, external dependency resolution changes that omit the relevant package-local `Package.resolved` diff, or Xcode project package-reference changes that omit the root Xcode `Package.resolved` diff.

The root Xcode project lockfile is not sufficient proof for standalone package resolution. Pass for vendored third-party directories preserving upstream policy.

## README and Site Feature Parity

For changes to `README.md`'s "## Features" section, the homepage feature list (`home.feature.*` in `web/messages/en.json`, rendered by `web/app/[locale]/page.tsx`), or the homepage FAQ (`home.faq*`), keep the user-facing feature claims consistent across the README and the marketing site.

Flag a shared feature renamed or relabeled on one surface but not the other (for example README "Scriptable" vs site "Programmable"), and any factual claim that contradicts across surfaces (platform support, price/free, license, supported agents, networking model, built-in vs optional). The README may stay the more detailed superset of the homepage; only the features both surfaces mention need consistent names and non-contradicting claims.

Pass for README-only extra features (SSH, Claude Code Teams, Custom commands, etc.), pure description or length differences where the feature name and factual claim still agree, and localization-only edits that preserve the English source meaning.

## No Ambient Global State

For production Swift, flag new ambient global surface that should be owned by a constructable, injectable type instead of living in global scope.

Flag a new top-level (file-scope) `func` used as API, a new top-level mutable `var` or a stub class/struct that exists only to hold a global flag/counter/once-token (for example a `resumeOnceFlag`), a caseless `enum` or empty `struct` used purely as a `static func`/`static let` namespace or a type whose API is mostly `static func`s, and a new singleton (`static let shared`/`standard`/`default`, or new state hung off the app delegate) introduced for runtime state that should be scoped and injected at the app seam. Widening a helper to `public`/`internal` global scope just to make it reachable is also a failure when the right shape is a method on the type that owns the data.

Pass for `private`/`fileprivate` file-scope pure helpers (preferred over a private-static helper bag), `static let` constants, enum cases, protocol/extension conformances, an existing singleton or static-namespace type only touched incidentally, and platform/bridge/`@main` boundaries that legitimately require top-level declarations.

## Hot-Path Allocating Formatting

For production Swift on hot, concurrent, or per-element paths (git index/path/signature encoding, terminal input/rendering, sidebar/feed/list rows, snapshot builders, and any per-byte/row/keystroke/frame loop or concurrent map), flag per-call allocating formatting.

Flag `String(format:)` with per-element conversions, a `NumberFormatter`/`DateFormatter`/`ISO8601DateFormatter`/`ByteCountFormatter` allocated per call inside a loop or row body, and repeated per-element string interpolation/concatenation building large intermediates where a preallocated buffer or single reserved-capacity build would avoid the churn. The canonical P0 is cmux PR https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/5347: `String(format:)` byte-to-hex in the concurrent git-index snapshot path allocated per call and caused unbounded memory growth and crashes on users' machines; the fix used a fixed hex lookup table written into a preallocated buffer.

Pass for cold paths (startup, settings, error/log construction), a formatter allocated once and reused, deterministic encoding via a fixed lookup table into a preallocated buffer, and tests/benchmarks or existing formatting the PR does not move into a hotter or concurrent path.

## Reliability and Single Source of Truth

For production code that detects, identifies, or tracks correctness-critical state (which coding agent is running, agent/session lifecycle and liveness, workspace/pane/surface identity, or any value the UI trusts to enable controls, route input, or show a specific conversation), require one reliable source of truth and no unreliable fallback.

Flag a correctness-critical value derived from a string/title/name heuristic (terminal title, window title, pane label, process-argv substring, display name) to decide agent type, session identity, liveness, or which conversation to show. Flag an "unreliable but better than nothing" fallback branch (a guess, a default, a best-effort branch) for state where a wrong value is a correctness bug. Flag more than one disagreeing source of truth for the same fact without one designated authority. Flag a throttle or polling interval placed on a correctness-critical read that introduces a visible staleness window when the consumer must reflect the change promptly.

Pass for detection that uses a reliable structured source (explicit session id, registered agent descriptor, typed lifecycle event), a missing reliable signal that fails closed (no detection, control disabled, empty state) rather than guessing, a heuristic used only for a genuinely cosmetic non-authoritative hint, and coalescing/debouncing that does not delay the observable correctness-critical value.

## React Base UI Accessibility

For React UI changes under `web/**/*.tsx` and `web/**/*.jsx`, prefer `@base-ui-components/react` or an existing local component when building custom composite widgets.

Flag custom dialogs, popovers, menus, context menus, checkboxes, selects, switches, tabs, tooltips, comboboxes, command menus, or similar interactive controls built from raw `div`/`span` elements, ad hoc ARIA, `tabIndex`, or hand-rolled keyboard handlers when Base UI or a shared component already provides the relevant primitive. Also flag wrappers around Base UI primitives that drop labels, focus restoration, controlled/uncontrolled state, keyboard support, or disabled/loading semantics.

Pass for native semantic elements (`button`, `a`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `details`, `summary`) when they satisfy the behavior, cases with no relevant primitive where the PR owns complete semantics and keyboard/focus behavior, and existing custom UI not worsened by the PR.

## Landing Page Registry Parity

For PRs that add a new marketing landing page under `web/app/[locale]/(landing)/<slug>/page.tsx`, require the new path to be registered in every dependent registry in the same PR.

Flag a new `(landing)` page (or a new path added to `web/app/sitemap.ts`) when it is missing from any of: `web/app/sitemap.ts`; `agentReadablePages` in `web/app/lib/agent-page-paths.ts` (this gives the page its `.md`/`.txt` agent-readable variant and `llms.txt` listing, and `tests/agent-page-variants.test.ts` asserts every sitemap path resolves to a variant, so a missing entry fails CI); the `ARTICLES` list in `web/app/[locale]/(landing)/guides/page.tsx`; or a `landing.links` label plus at least one internal cross-link from a sibling page. Also flag `agentReadablePages`/`sitemap.ts` drift, where a path exists in one but not the other.

Localization of the new page copy into every locale is covered by the internationalization rule, not this one.

Pass for routes intentionally kept out of the sitemap (legal, deeplink, redirect-only) when excluded consistently and not added to `agentReadablePages` either, non-landing routes, edits to existing landing pages, and existing registry drift the PR does not introduce or worsen.
