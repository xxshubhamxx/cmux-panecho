# cmux Billing

Read before changing billing, pricing, Stripe, Pro entitlement, checkout, webhook, or subscription code.

## Architecture map

- `/api/billing/checkout` creates Stripe Checkout Sessions for Pro when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set. It sets `client_reference_id` to the Stack user id, auto-creates an anonymous Stack user for signed-out buyers, and falls back to the legacy Stack purchase path when Stripe is unset or `plan=team`. The "already active" short-circuit lives here.
- `/api/billing/portal` resolves the current Stack user, looks up their `stripe_customers` row, and creates a Stripe customer portal session returning to `/pricing`.
- `/api/billing/subscription` cancels or resumes the active Stripe Pro subscription; `/dashboard/billing` renders localized in-dashboard plan state and self-serve actions.
- `web/services/billing/purchase.ts` is the shared idempotent recorder used by `/api/billing/complete` and `/api/stripe/webhook`. It attaches email to the purchaser, records `billing_email_claims` on conflict, and never cross-grants based on an unverified email.
- VM code reads the plan from Stack `clientReadOnlyMetadata`: a non-empty `cmuxVmPlan` (operator override) takes precedence, otherwise `cmuxPlan` (the Stripe mirror) supplies the entitlement. `resolveProPlanStatus` reports Pro for an active `stripe_subscriptions` row or a paid `cmuxVmPlan` override (`pro`, `team`, `founders`); `billingManagement` stays Stripe-only, so a granted account shows Pro without a portal link.
- The private cmux-admin app (https://cmux-admin.vercel.app/pro, source `admin/` in cmuxterm-hq) lets verified `cmux.com`, `manaflow.ai`, and `manaflow.com` accounts search users, teams, and emails and, after a confirmation dialog: grant or remove the user `cmuxVmPlan` override (`/api/admin/users`), grant or remove a team override of `team` (`/api/admin/teams`), grant Pro to an email with no account yet (`/api/admin/email-grants`, stored in `admin_plan_grants` and applied by the after-sign-in callback once the mailbox is verified), and downgrade a paying customer by cancelling the Stripe subscription at period end (`/api/admin/subscriptions`, same service as the self-serve form). `services/admin/access.ts` is the gate, `services/admin/proGrants.ts` writes under the account-mutation lease and records `serverMetadata.cmuxAdminPlanGrant` (who, when, which plan). Non-admins get 403 on the API; there is no admin page on cmux.com. The `admin_plan_grants` migration is an operator step; until it runs, pending email grants report 503 and search omits them.
- `/api/stripe/webhook` is signature-verified, insert-first idempotent through `stripe_webhook_events`, safe for foreign events in the shared Stripe account, and gates cmux handling on `metadata.app === "cmux"`. Return 2xx only after durable writes; return 500 to make Stripe retry.

## Dev workflow

- Use `web/scripts/stripe/dev-stack.sh`.
- Local `bun dev` accounts use the development Stack project and receive a
  non-persistent Pro entitlement automatically. This applies only when
  `CMUX_LOCAL_DEV_PRO=1`, `NODE_ENV=development`, `VERCEL_ENV` is unset, and
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID` is the development project. Release and
  preview deployments remain billing-backed. Use `dev-grant.sh` only when
  testing an explicit manual grant or a non-local deployment.
- The tagged app bakes `CMUX_PORT` into `Info.plist`; run the dev server on the tag's printed port, never a hardcoded one.
- Per-branch Docker Postgres ports collide with other agents' containers. Use `--db-port` and never stop containers you did not create.
- `/app-pricing` requires `cmux_app=1`. `cmux_scheme` threads the native deeplink return scheme; `cmux-dev-*` schemes are honored only for localhost requests.
- Repeat dogfood: use a private window for a fresh anonymous buyer, and `web/scripts/stripe/dev-reset.sh <email>` to un-Pro a signed-in dev account before retesting checkout.
- Fake payment, two ways: `web/scripts/stripe/dev-grant.sh <email>` writes `cmuxVmPlan: "pro"` directly (same override as the admin page) (instant, no checkout; undo with dev-reset). For the full checkout path at $0, enter promotion code `CMUXDEV100` in test-mode checkout — a 100%-off forever coupon in the test account; `allow_promotion_codes` is already set on checkout sessions.
- Newer Stripe CLI prints `stripe config --list` as `key=value` (older builds used `key = 'value'`); dev-stack.sh and dev-reset.sh accept both. If key extraction fails, re-run `stripe login`.

## Catalog

Prices live in `web/services/billing/plans.ts` and are provisioned by `web/scripts/stripe/provision-catalog.sh`. Current checkout keys: `cmux-go-monthly-10` ($10/mo), `cmux-pro-monthly-50` ($50/mo), `cmux-max-monthly-200` ($200/mo, monthly only, no yearly Price on purpose), `cmux-team-monthly-60` ($60/user/mo), all billed monthly. Go and Max are personal plans like Pro: the user-scoped subscription row's `plan` column is derived from its Price lookup key (`personalPlanIdForSubscription`), `cmuxPlan` mirrors the exact purchased plan, and every `isPro` check passes. A Pro subscriber who buys Max goes through `/api/billing/portal?flow=switch_plan&plan=max`, which opens Stripe's subscription-update flow with the portal configuration stamped `metadata.purpose=personal_plan_switch` (the script provisions it; the account default configuration stays quantity-only). Stripe amounts are immutable, so a price change mints a new lookup key carrying the amount and adds the old key to `LEGACY_PRICE_LOOKUP_KEYS`; grandfathered Prices (`cmux-pro-monthly` $30, `cmux-pro-yearly` $240, `cmux-pro-yearly-288` $288, `cmux-team-monthly` $35, `cmux-team-yearly-336` $336, `cmux-pro-yearly-480` $480, `cmux-team-yearly-576` $576) stay active for the subscriptions on them and `/dashboard/billing` prices every row from its own Stripe amount. Env price-id overrides carry the amount in their name (`STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_50_PRICE_ID` and friends); a retired name fails env validation, so delete it from Vercel before deploying a price change. Test-mode Pro product `prod_UyHgRPpmCzrkLJ`, live `prod_Uq4a28vk0fP3E6`; test-mode Max product `prod_VEpLXrLxxrIFTx` (price `price_1UELhFLbtiW1udY8YwbWvt0P`, switch portal `bpc_1UELhHLbtiW1udY89mZWzSi0`); live Max product `prod_VEpRwst8UwD5cm` (price `price_1UELmdGhInAdn3Jb8Gpe9ilK`, switch portal `bpc_1UELmeGhInAdn3JbgZqLIbP0`). `STRIPE_PERSONAL_PLAN_SWITCH_PORTAL_CONFIGURATION_ID` is pinned in Vercel (production = live id, development and preview = test id) so the restricted production key never has to list portal configurations. Staging webhook endpoint `we_1Tq1SZGhInAdn3JbWJReKNEN` forwards to `cmux-staging.vercel.app`; its secrets are already in the `cmux-staging` Vercel project.

The paid Cloud VM allowance lives in `web/services/vms/machineSpec.ts`: Pro allows up to 50 machines for one paid account. Team grants 50 machines per paid seat. Each machine has its own CPU, memory, and disk; there is no aggregate resource pool. The default machine has 8 GB RAM and 32 GB disk. Free, Pro, Team, and Founder's machines stop at 24 GB RAM (`PLAN_MAX_MEMORY_MB`); the 32 GB and 64 GB ladder rows are what Max sells (`maxMemoryMbForPlan("max")`). The machine list publishes `lockedMemoryOptionsMb` and `memoryUpgradePlanId`, and a create that asks for a locked size gets `402 vm_memory_requires_plan` instead of a silently smaller machine. Disk grows independently up to 256 GB. The repository enforces machine counts under the billing-team lock and tracks individual shapes for fork, snapshot, and resize recovery. Paid-limit environment overrides are retired; the create kill switch remains the incident control.

New annual checkout requests return `annual_unavailable` before creating Stripe state. Annual prices stay active only for existing subscriptions; new checkout price resolution and the personal plan-switch portal allow monthly offers only. Pricing views and CTA analytics always report `interval: month` and `discount_percent: 0`.

## Feature flags

`pro-upgrade-ui-enabled-release` (PostHog id `741838`) gates all Pro UI and stays OFF in release until launch; DEBUG builds default it on. Public Pro and Team pricing CTAs always route through `/api/billing/checkout`, never the download confirmation page. `cmux __internal_flags`, once merged, inspects and overrides flags locally.

## Prod runbook

Run `web/scripts/stripe/provision-live.sh` with an operator key, add the two Vercel envs, deploy, validate live with a 100-percent-off promotion code purchase, then cancel.

DB migrations: `bun run cloud-vm:preflight`, `bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- staging`, staging deploy, then `bun run cloud-vm:migrate -- production`. Never run migrations from builds. See the Cloud VM ops flow.

## Gotchas

- `bun mock.module` is process-global, so every module mock must carry every real export other suite files import. A missing export can surface only in CI's test order as `Export named X not found`.
- Tests must not depend on `DATABASE_URL` being set.
- drizzle-1.0-beta wraps pg errors in `DrizzleQueryError`; read `error.cause` for the pg `code` and `constraint`.
- Pages outside `app/[locale]` need a `proxy.ts` bypass (like `/app-pricing` and `/billing`), or `next-intl` rewrites them into the locale tree and they 404 through missing root layout tags. Those subtrees also need their own layout with `html` and `body`.
