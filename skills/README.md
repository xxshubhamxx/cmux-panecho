# Find the right CMUX skill

Choose by the task: operating the installed app and changing its implementation
use different instructions. Load the matching `SKILL.md`, then only the reference
needed for the current operation. Installed CLI `--help` owns available commands
and flags; repository instructions own build and test rules.

## Working on the repository

Run repository commands only from a [trusted checkout](../docs/contributor-verification.md#trust-boundary);
even `verify-local.py --help` and `--list` load repository code.

For a local iteration, start with `python3 scripts/verify-local.py --help`.
`--swift-changed` discovers current Swift edits; `--list` exposes focused checks.
See [cmux-testing](cmux-testing/SKILL.md) for the boundary between static checks,
parsing, test compilation, executed tests and runtime evidence.

| Inspect or change windows, workspaces, panes and surfaces | [cmux](cmux/SKILL.md) |
| Work in the caller's existing workspace without disrupting it | [cmux-workspace](cmux-workspace/SKILL.md) |
| Browser automation | [cmux-browser](cmux-browser/SKILL.md) |
| Operate Cloud machines and their persistent workspaces | [cmux-cloud-vm](cmux-cloud-vm/SKILL.md) |

| Diagnose installed hooks, settings, restore or socket access | [cmux-diagnostics](cmux-diagnostics/SKILL.md) |
| Display a Markdown file in a viewer | [cmux-markdown](cmux-markdown/SKILL.md) |

Start with diagnostics for a user's broken installation; use debugging when
investigating or changing the source implementation. Similarly, Cloud VM operations
belong to `cmux-cloud-vm`, while its service implementation belongs to `cmux-backend`.
