# Remote CLI relay authorization (GHSA-9vmv-3hjw-j28c)

Use this when adding or changing a v2 socket method, a remote CLI command
(`daemon/remote/cmd/cmuxd-remote/commands.go`), or the relay policy.

Every v2 socket method you add or touch is a potential `cmux ssh` relay payload.
The relay on the remote host authenticates but does not trust:
`RemoteRelayCommandPolicy`
(`Packages/macOS/CmuxRemoteWorkspace/Sources/CmuxRemoteWorkspace/Relay/`) denies
every method by default and only forwards an allowlist, scoped to objects the
remote session owns. Command-bearing params (`initial_command`, `command`,
`tmux_start_command`, `pane_start_command`) are denied on every method. The one
key that is not a command is `command` inside the `effects` patch of
`notification.create_for_target`: a flat object of known effect names with JSON
boolean values, where `command` only toggles the user's own
`notifications.command`. Any other shape of that object is still denied.

The `surface.resume.*` methods are not relay methods: a resume binding holds a
command that runs on the Mac, and no remote flow needs to read, write or clear
one. The app also drops relay-originated bindings
(`ControlSurfaceResumeTarget.registeredBinding` returns `nil` when the request
carries a remote workspace ID); keep that check as a second layer.

Relay callers see only what they need. `notification.create_for_target` takes no
`reply_shape`, and the app delivers it with the relay origin, no reply and the
remote destination in the title. `workspace.remote.status` and the
`terminal_session_*` lifecycle methods return only `enabled`, `state` and
`connected` in `remote` for a relay caller, and omit `window_id` and
`window_ref`.

## Checklist

1. **Default is deny, and deny is safe.** A new method that is not added to the
   policy allowlist does not work through `cmux ssh`. Add it only when the remote
   product flow needs it.
2. **Answer in the PR description before allowlisting a method:**
   - Can it execute commands or open content on local objects (spawn terminals,
     respawn, send keys or text, eval scripts, open URLs)?
   - Can it mutate or destroy objects the remote session does not own (close,
     rename or delete by ID)?
   - Does it read local state the remote has no business seeing?

   If any answer is yes, do not allowlist it; reshape the method or its params.
3. **Never allowlist a method that spawns or respawns terminals** unless you have
   verified in the running app that the target executes on the remote host. The
   plain-SSH respawn path falls back to local execution under the same surface
   ID; that is why `surface.respawn` is denied.
4. **Cover new ID params with the policy's scoped key sets** (`workspaceIDKeys`,
   `surfaceIDKeys`, `ambiguousIDKeys`, and the array variants). A new
   `*_workspace_id`-shaped param name that is not added to the sets is unscoped.
5. **Add policy tests** in `RemoteCLIRelayPolicyTests`
   (`Packages/macOS/CmuxRemoteWorkspace/Tests/CmuxRemoteWorkspaceTests/RemoteCLIRelayPolicyTests.swift`):
   the allow case with an owned target, and the deny cases (unmapped target,
   command params).

## Review

A PR that adds a method to the allowlist without this analysis is a security
regression and is blocked in review. The review bot enforces it through
[`.github/review-bot-rules/remote-relay-authorization.md`](../../../.github/review-bot-rules/remote-relay-authorization.md).
