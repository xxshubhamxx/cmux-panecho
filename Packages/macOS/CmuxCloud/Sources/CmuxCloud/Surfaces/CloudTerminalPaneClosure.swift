/// thing left holding it open. Closing is driven by the accepted graph, so the
/// rule lives here instead of inside the provider's refresh.

    ///   - boundTerminals: local pane id -> remote terminal resource key.

    ///     machine is unreachable, not that a terminal ended, so nothing closes.

    ///     recognized tab. An incomplete inventory cannot prove a terminal ended.
