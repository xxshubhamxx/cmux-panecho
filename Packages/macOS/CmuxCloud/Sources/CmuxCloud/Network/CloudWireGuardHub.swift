/// The app's one in-process WireGuard tunnel into the user's private Cloud VM
/// network, held by a single `cmux-tui wg hub` child that serves SOCKS5 on an
/// owner-only unix socket. Every headless machine link (`remote connect
/// --wireguard-hub <socket>`) dials its VM through that socket.
///
/// One WireGuard key supports one live session, and the app spawns one link
/// process per machine, so those processes cannot each own a tunnel: the hub is
/// the single owner and the links are its clients. It uses the terminal tunnel
/// role, which is separate from the browser Network Extension tunnel role.
///
/// Lifecycle: the first ``acquire()`` uses the saved config, or enrolls the
/// app identity once when no config exists. It then spawns the hub and
/// resolves once the socket accepts connections.
/// Leases are released as links end; ``idleGrace`` after the last release the
/// hub stops. A hub that exits while leases are held is restarted with bounded
/// backoff (the links' own reconnect loops then find the socket again). A pane
/// that runs the full client (`cmux vm tui`) is a process the app cannot watch,
/// so ``pinForExternalClient()`` keeps the hub for the rest of the app session.
