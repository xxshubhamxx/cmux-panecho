/// Two decisions are encoded here and both are deliberate.
///
/// First, cmux declares no `fs.*` and no `terminal.*` client requirements. A
/// sandboxed ACP agent asks its client to read and write files on its behalf;
/// cmux's agents are ordinary CLIs running on the real filesystem with their
/// own tools. Proxying their I/O through the client would be slower, lossier,
/// and would misreport who touched the disk.
///
/// Second, the cmux-specific flags live under `_meta`, not under a top-level
/// `_cmux` key. ACP reserves underscore prefixes on *method* names for
/// extensions and `_meta` on *objects*, so `_meta.cmux` is where a capability
/// a client has to feature-detect belongs.
