# CMUXAgentLaunch

`CMUXAgentLaunch` owns launch, restore, and environment policy for coding
agents. New value-level policy APIs accept captured inputs directly, while
executable targets keep process mutation at their own seams.

## Testing Claude Teams respawn transport

Construct a transport with an explicit environment dictionary, then inspect the
decoded value without launching cmux or mutating the test process:

```swift
let transport = ClaudeTeamsRespawnEnvironmentTransport()
let encoded = transport.encodedValue(from: [
    "PATH": "/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
    "CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR": "/tmp/claude-config",
])
let decoded = transport.decodedEnvironment(from: encoded)
```

The transport applies `AgentLaunchEnvironmentPolicy` while encoding and again
while decoding, so tests can also prove that credentials and process identity
fail closed at the transport boundary.
