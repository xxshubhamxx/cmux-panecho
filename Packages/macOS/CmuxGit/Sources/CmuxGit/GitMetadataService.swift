/// Reads a directory's git metadata directly from the on-disk repository,
/// without spawning a `git` process.
///
/// This service does the filesystem work that powers the workspace sidebar's
/// branch label, dirty indicator, and pull-request badge: resolving the
/// enclosing repository, parsing `HEAD`/`index`/`config`, and deriving the set
/// of paths a filesystem watcher should observe to know when that metadata
/// becomes stale.
///
/// It is a stateless `Sendable` value, not an `actor`, because it has no mutable
/// shared state for an actor to protect — every read is a pure function of the
/// `directory` argument. The reads do blocking filesystem work (walking to the
/// repository, parsing the git `index`/`config`), and are plain `nonisolated async`
/// methods (a struct's `async` methods are nonisolated): a `nonisolated async`
/// function runs on the global concurrent executor, not the caller's actor
/// (SE-0338), so `await git.workspaceMetadata(...)` from the main actor offloads
/// the work off the main thread *and* lets reads for independent repositories run
/// in parallel. An `actor` would instead funnel every read through one serial
/// executor and, since these methods never suspend internally, run them strictly
/// sequentially — a bottleneck for concurrent per-workspace reads, protecting
/// nothing. (If this ever gains an in-memory cache, promote it to an `actor`
/// then — the mutable state would justify the serialization.)
///
/// - Important: If the package ever adopts the `NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault`
///   upcoming feature, a bare `nonisolated async` method flips to running on the
///   *caller's* actor (the main thread, here). At that point these reads must be
///   annotated `@concurrent` to keep them off the main thread.
///

/// let git = GitMetadataService()

/// if meta.isRepository, meta.isDirty { showDirtyIndicator() }
