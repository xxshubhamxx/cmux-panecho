/// Decides what a right-click over a terminal link may offer.
///
/// Cmd-click already opens a link, but it commits the user to one destination:
/// whichever the `openTerminalLinksInCmuxBrowser` setting names. A link is often
/// worth opening the other way round, or worth copying rather than opening at
/// all, and today the only route to either is to select the text by hand. This
/// is the policy behind the context-menu items that close that gap.
///
/// It is separate from ``TerminalLinkRouter`` because the two answer different
/// questions. The router answers "where does this go by default", which is a
/// property of the URL. This answers "what may the user ask for", which also
/// depends on what those requests would mean: offering cmux's browser for a
/// `mailto:` link would be offering something that cannot happen.
///
/// The hardest part is not the schemes, it is that what ghostty highlights is
/// not always a URL. Its default matchers also highlight bare relative paths
/// such as `src/config/url.zig`, and the omnibox resolver will happily turn
/// any scheme-less text holding a dot or a slash into `https://<text>`. Left
/// alone that produces `https://src/config/url.zig`, a host nobody can reach,
/// offered next to a cmd-click that opens the file in the user's editor. Two
/// guards below keep paths out: ``FileResolution`` for the ones that exist on
/// this machine, and the host shape check for the rest.
