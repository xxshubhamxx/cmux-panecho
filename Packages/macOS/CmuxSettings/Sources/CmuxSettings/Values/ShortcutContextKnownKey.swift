/// can reference, modeled on VS Code's `when`-clause context keys.

/// This enum is the single source of truth for the documented key vocabulary: its
/// raw values are the exact names usable in `shortcuts.when` predicates, and the
/// app target references these cases when populating a ``ShortcutContext`` at key
/// dispatch (so key names never drift between declaration and runtime).
///
/// Unknown keys are still permitted in a clause — ``ShortcutWhenClause/parse(_:)``
/// accepts any bareword and an absent key evaluates to `false`, matching VS Code.
/// This catalog is what tooling (docs, autocomplete) advertises as supported.
///
/// The focus keys (``sidebarFocus``, ``browserFocus``, ``markdownFocus``,
/// ``filePreviewTextEditorFocus``, ``simulatorFocus``, ``terminalFocus``) are
/// also expressed as ``ShortcutFocusAtom`` cases; a clause referencing one of
/// those names parses to ``ShortcutWhenClause/atom(_:)`` rather than
/// ``ShortcutWhenClause/key(_:)`` so existing focus behavior is preserved.
