// The readiness state machine's terminal transition and the deadline that
// guarantees it is reached (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/12813).
//
// A session seeks readiness: daemon hello, then reverse relay, then a
// published proxy endpoint. The bootstrap and reachability policies already
// bound the phases that can fail outright. The relay restart loop and the
// escalate-and-rebootstrap cycle are retry loops with no terminal transition
// of their own, so a relay or proxy that can never come up used to leave the
// session "reconnecting" forever while every `ssh-pty-attach --wait` parked on
// it timed out and retried. The deadline gives those phases a verdict too, and
// parking hands that verdict to the waiters.
