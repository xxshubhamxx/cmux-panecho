/// Replaces the legacy `GhosttyPasteboardHelper` namespace enum. Exactly one
/// instance must serve the whole process: temporary-file ownership and the
/// one-shot write capture are process-wide hand-offs between independent call
/// sites (a file materialized by the paste path is cleaned up by an upload
/// completion), so splitting them across instances would silently leak files.

/// once. The ghostty write-clipboard callback fires on runtime threads and
/// cannot await, view paste paths run on the main actor, and upload
/// completions land on background queues. An actor would force `async` onto
/// the C callback path and `@MainActor` would require `assumeIsolated`, so the
/// service is nonisolated and `Sendable`: mutable ownership, capture, and
/// transaction-lane state are lock guarded, the sanctioned shape for state
