/// Background (issue #6366): Sparkle resolves an appcast item when a check finds an update and
/// hands it to the UI. If the user installs from that prompt later, replying `.install` installs
/// *that captured item*, even if a newer release shipped in the meantime. The user then relaunches
/// straight into another "update available" prompt. The fix is to always run a fresh check at
/// install time and install whatever that fresh check resolves.
///
/// The coordinator is intentionally pure — it has no Sparkle dependency and performs no work
/// itself. ``UpdateController`` feeds it the user's request plus each subsequent ``UpdateState``
/// change and performs the returned ``Action``. Keeping the policy here (rather than inline in the
/// controller, which owns a live `SPUUpdater`) makes the install-resolution behavior deterministic
/// and unit-testable without a live updater.
