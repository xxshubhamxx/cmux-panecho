/// Watches a set of filesystem paths recursively and reports changes as a
/// coalesced `AsyncStream<Void>`.
///
/// Construct one with the paths to watch (the caller resolves which paths matter
/// for its domain) and consume ``events`` to react to changes:
///
/// ```swift
/// guard let watcher = RecursivePathWatcher(paths: paths) else { return }
/// let task = Task { @MainActor in
///     for await _ in watcher.events { reload() }
/// }
/// // later: task.cancel(); await watcher.stop()
/// ```
///
/// **Coalescing.** A leading-edge throttle folds a burst into one yield: the
/// first event in a window arms a single bounded delay (``FileWatchClock``) and
/// events arriving while that delay is pending are folded into it. Combined with
/// the underlying `FSEventStream` latency, the worst-case delay from a change to
/// an ``events`` element is roughly twice the throttle interval. During a
/// sustained storm an element is yielded at most once per window — it does *not*
/// wait for changes to stop, which keeps reactions responsive without per-event
/// churn.
///
/// **Construction.** The `FSEventStream` is created synchronously in ``init``,
/// so the watcher is already listening when it returns (nothing is missed in the
/// gap a deferred start would open) and ``init`` fails (`nil`) if the stream
/// cannot be created. The stream's `@Sendable` sink forwards into a private
/// raw-event `AsyncStream` rather than capturing the actor, which is what lets
/// creation happen in-`init`; a single actor-isolated pump drains that raw stream
/// and applies the throttle. The pump's lifetime is the raw stream's: ``stop()``
/// and `deinit` finish it.
