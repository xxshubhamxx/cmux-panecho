/// A thin owner of an `FSEventStream` that reports raw filesystem events through
/// a `@Sendable` sink.
///
/// `FSEventStream` is a C API with no async-native replacement, and it is the
/// only macOS primitive that watches a *set of paths recursively* with a single
/// coalescing stream (a `DispatchSource` file source watches one descriptor and
/// does not recurse). It stays hidden behind this type; consumers
/// (``RecursivePathWatcher``) observe events only via the watcher's
/// `AsyncStream`. The stream is configured for file-level events.
///
/// **Threading.** Every instance shares one serial dispatch queue (rather than
/// one queue per stream) to bound thread usage when many workspaces are tracked.
/// All mutable state is touched only on that queue, which is why the type is
/// `@unchecked Sendable`. ``onEvent`` fires on the shared queue, so it MUST be
/// non-blocking — a slow sink would serialize behind every other stream's
/// teardown. The production sink only spawns a `Task` and returns.
///
/// **Context lifetime.** The stream is registered with FSEvents as its own
/// context `info` pointer, passed *unretained* (no `retain`/`release` callbacks).
/// That is safe because ``stop()`` invalidates the stream synchronously on the
/// shared queue before `deinit` returns: FSEvents delivers callbacks on that
/// same serial queue, so any in-flight or already-enqueued callback runs to
/// completion before the `queue.sync` teardown block, and none is delivered
/// after `FSEventStreamInvalidate`. No callback ever touches a freed instance,
/// so a separately retained context box is unnecessary.
