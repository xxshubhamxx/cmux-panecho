/// its workspace immediately, as it always has. In
/// ``WorkspaceAutoReorderMode/agentActivity`` mode notifications and
/// meaningful agent transitions share one throttle so a burst of activity
/// moves a row at most once per cooldown:
///
/// - Pinned and selected workspaces never move; the user is already looking
///   at the selected one, and pinned rows keep their place.
/// - A workspace already first in its tier is left alone, and a deferred
///   request for it is dropped: one agent event that also notifies must not
///   produce a second, trailing move that lifts the row back over newer
///   activity or a manual drag.
/// - While the pointer is over the sidebar or a sidebar drag is running, the
///   move is deferred, never dropped, so rows do not jump under the cursor.
/// - A workspace that moved less than ``cooldown`` ago is deferred until the
///   cooldown ends. Deferred requests for one workspace coalesce into a
///   single pending move. A notification inside the cooldown is dropped
///   instead, since it restates activity that already moved the row.
///
/// ``drain(mode:now:context:)`` releases pending moves oldest first, so the
/// most recent activity ends up on top. The gate is a value type with no
/// clock or UI access; the caller supplies the time and each workspace's
