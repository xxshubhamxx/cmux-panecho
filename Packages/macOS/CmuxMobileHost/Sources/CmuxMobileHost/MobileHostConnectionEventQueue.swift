/// recover without the host replaying the exact dropped payload:
/// - `terminal.render_grid`: the producer is asked to re-emit a full frame for
///   every surface whose queued frame was shed
///   (``MobileTerminalRenderObserver/requestRenderGridFullResync(surfaceIDStrings:)``),
///   and the per-connection queue refuses further deltas for that surface until
///   the full frame arrives. The iOS client has no delta-continuity check, so a
///   silently dropped delta would corrupt its grid invisibly; the
///   poison-until-full rule makes a shed unobservable beyond one stale paint.
/// - `simulator.frame`: video-style JPEG frames are absolute snapshots keyed by
///   panel id. When a phone cannot drain at the simulator's frame cadence, the
///   newest frame replaces older queued frames; simulator state and ownership
///   events stay lossless.
/// - `terminal.bytes`: chunks carry a byte-offset `seq`; the client detects the
///   gap and requests a replay on its own.
/// - `terminal.updated` / `workspace.updated`: level-triggered pings; the newer
///   occurrence that forced the shed supersedes the shed one.
///
/// Other topics retain their ordered payloads even beyond the shedding budget.
/// Congestion is not evidence that the connection has closed.
