/// The window-side seam the sidebar git services drive: snapshot reads of
/// workspace/panel state, synchronous projection writes of branch and
/// pull-request badges, and the environment toggles the schedulers honor.
///
/// **Why a synchronous two-way protocol and not an AsyncStream of results.**
/// Every state transition in the legacy subsystem is one MainActor turn that
/// interleaves reads (does the panel still exist, is its directory still the
/// probed one) with writes (badge updates, probe bookkeeping) and immediate
/// follow-up scheduling. Pushing the writes through a stream would open a
/// suspension window between a probe completing and its projection landing,
/// during which user-driven mutations (directory change, panel close) could
/// interleave — an observable behavior change to badge transitions. The
/// services therefore stay `@MainActor` and call the host synchronously,
/// preserving the legacy interleavings exactly; the host (the per-window
/// `TabManager`) is the single implementer.
///
/// All identifier pairs are (workspace id, panel id); reads return `nil` or
/// empty values when the workspace/panel is gone, mirroring the legacy
/// `tabs.first(where:)` lookups.
