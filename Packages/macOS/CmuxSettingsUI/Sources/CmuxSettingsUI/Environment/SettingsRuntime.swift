/// actors, the error log is a `@MainActor` class, the account flow is a

/// `@LiveSetting` holds `@Environment(\.settingsRuntime)`, so a struct
/// runtime was stored inline in every view that uses one. Copying or
/// destroying such a view then moved the full catalog word by word, and the
/// Release compiler emitted hundreds of kilobytes of code per view witness and
/// capturing closure (8 minutes of LLVM time for `ContentView.swift` alone).
/// A reference keeps each of those sites to one retain or release.
