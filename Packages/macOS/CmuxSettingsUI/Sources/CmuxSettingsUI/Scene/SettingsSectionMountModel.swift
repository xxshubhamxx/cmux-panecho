/// `NSWindow(contentViewController:)` before the window is ordered front,

/// The model keeps the "every mounted anchor exists" guarantee while
/// spreading construction over update passes. The section the window
/// opens on is mounted in the first pass; the scene then mounts one more
/// section per pass, each hopped off the previous section's `onAppear` (a
/// real "that content is in the hierarchy" signal), so input events are
/// serviced between chunks. Navigation to a section that is not mounted
/// yet mounts it immediately and defers the scroll until that section
/// appears.
