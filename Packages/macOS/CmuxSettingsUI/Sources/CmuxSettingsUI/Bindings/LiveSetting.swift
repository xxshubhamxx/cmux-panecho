/// Property wrapper that binds a SwiftUI view to one catalog setting, holding
/// the latest value in its own `@State` so it stays reactive in **any** host —
/// including the main window's AppKit `NSHostingView`.
///
/// A settings binding backed by an `@Observable` model whose value is updated
/// from the store's `AsyncStream` does not re-invalidate an
/// `NSHostingView`-hosted subtree on that off-render update (SwiftUI's
/// Observation doesn't drive the host's redraw there). ``LiveSetting`` removes
/// that dependency: a ``SettingReadDriver`` forwards the store's `values(for:)`
/// stream into a private `@State`, so re-rendering rides on `@State`
/// invalidation (host-agnostic). Because every store exposes `values(for:)`,
/// one wrapper covers UserDefaults-, JSON-, and secret-backed keys with a
/// single code path and no raw `@AppStorage` string keys.
///
/// You always pass a catalog key path, so the catalog stays the single
/// definition of the key, default, and storage:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct SidebarFooter: View {
///     @LiveSetting(\.betaFeatures.extensions) private var extensionsEnabled
///     var body: some View { if extensionsEnabled { PuzzleButton() } }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Each `init` captures the store's `values(for:)` and `set(_:for:)` for its key
/// kind as closures — done there because that is where the key-kind type
/// information (e.g. a secret's `Value == String`) is in scope, so the secret
/// store's `AsyncStream<String>` is used directly as `AsyncStream<Value>` with
/// no wrapping or casting. Reads work without an injected ``SettingsRuntime``
/// (the `@State` is seeded from the catalog default); the runtime is only
/// needed to observe and persist changes, resolved from the environment.
