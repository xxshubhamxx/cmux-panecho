/// `@Observable` view-model that projects one ``JSONKey`` value into
/// SwiftUI-bindable state.
///
/// Same shape as ``DefaultsValueModel`` but bound to a ``JSONConfigStore``.
/// Set / reset failures populate the model's ``lastWriteError`` *and* are
/// pushed into the optional injected ``SettingsErrorLog`` so the UI can
/// surface them centrally; the model never silently swallows a failure.
///
/// Lifecycle: the observation is owned by a ``SettingReadDriver`` held by the
/// model; the driver's `deinit` cancels the iterating task when the model
/// deallocates, finishing the change stream and tearing down its underlying
/// observation. A bare `weak self` is **not** enough — the parked task never
/// re-checks `self` for an idle key (see
/// https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5302).
