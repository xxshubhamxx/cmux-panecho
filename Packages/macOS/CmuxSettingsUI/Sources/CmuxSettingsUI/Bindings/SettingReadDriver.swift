import SwiftUI

/// Owns the lifecycle of one settings-store change-stream subscription:
/// a single `Task` that forwards each element from an `AsyncStream<Value>`
/// into a caller-supplied sink, and cancels that task when the driver is
/// deallocated.
///
/// This is the single source of truth for "observe a setting" teardown. The
/// owning object (a SwiftUI `@State` for ``LiveSetting``, or an `@Observable`
/// value model such as ``DefaultsValueModel``) holds the driver; when the
/// owner deallocates, the driver's `deinit` cancels the task. That
/// cancellation propagates into the parked `for await`, finishing the stream
/// and firing its `onTermination`, which tears down the underlying
/// `NotificationCenter.notifications(named:)` sequence. Relying on `weak self`
/// inside the loop is **not** sufficient: the task is suspended at the `await`
/// and never re-evaluates `self` for an idle key, so the subscription would
/// leak (see https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/5302).
///
/// The driver is store-agnostic — it only needs an `AsyncStream<Value>` — so
/// the same path works for every key kind (UserDefaults, JSON, secret) and
/// for both `@State`-backed and `@Observable`-backed consumers.

    /// created once for the lifetime of the owning object.
