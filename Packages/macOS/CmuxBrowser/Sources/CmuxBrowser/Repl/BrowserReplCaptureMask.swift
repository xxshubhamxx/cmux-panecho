/// Hides secret values in one screenshot or PDF of a tab, and refuses a

///
/// The session sends a capture its `secretMasks` (`[{ value, domains }]`).
/// In every frame whose document's origin is on a secret's domains (the
/// only frames it can be typed into), fields and text holding a value
/// render as password dots (`-webkit-text-security`) for the length of the
/// capture. Other frames never get a value. The scan runs in a content
/// world of its own, which page scripts and agent code cannot reach, and
/// which sees closed shadow roots as the agent's world does, so a value the
/// agent can read there is masked there too.
///
/// A frame keeps its id when it navigates, so the frame list WebKit gives
/// can name a document the frame no longer shows. The mask therefore goes
/// by documents, not by that list: before the capture it marks every
/// frame's document with the capture's token and reads its origin there,
/// picks the values from that origin, and masks only in a document that
/// still holds the mark. After the capture every frame must still show a
/// marked document, so none showed another page meanwhile (a navigation
/// gives the frame a new global object, without the mark).
///
/// The domain policy judges the document each frame shows when it is
/// marked, the one the capture shows. A blocked main frame refuses the
/// capture. A blocked child frame refuses a capture that cannot hide it (a
/// PDF, ``BlockedChildFrames/refuse``); a screenshot is handed those
/// frames and blanks them (``BlockedChildFrames/handToCapture``).
///
/// It fails closed. The capture is refused when a frame does not answer
/// (`stale` when a script takes over the probe's bound, 5 s by default),
/// shows a page the domain policy blocks (as above), shows a document it
/// did not show when the capture was prepared, or when the mask step fails, or
/// when, after the capture, a scan finds an element holding a value that
/// does not render masked (the page dropped the mask or added the value
/// while the capture ran). The page owns its DOM, so a value it changes
/// and restores within the capture, or draws in a form the scan does not
/// read (a canvas, an image, split across elements, transformed), is not
/// caught.
///
/// Each capture records the elements it masked under its own token and
/// restores only those, so concurrent captures do not unmask each other.
