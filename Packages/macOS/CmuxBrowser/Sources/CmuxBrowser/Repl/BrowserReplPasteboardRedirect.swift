/// Runs WebKit's own Copy, Cut and Paste editing commands against a REPL
/// tab's private pasteboard instead of the system clipboard.
///
/// WebKit has no per-web-view pasteboard: WebCore's Copy, Cut and Paste
/// always name the general pasteboard (`Pasteboard::createForCopyAndPaste`
/// takes no name), and the UI process answers the web process's pasteboard
/// IPC through `WebCore::PlatformPasteboard`, which looks the pasteboard up
/// by name (`+[NSPasteboard pasteboardWithName:]`) on the main thread, later
/// than the synchronous call. (`-[WKWebView readSelectionFromPasteboard:]`
/// takes a pasteboard and fires a trusted `paste`, but it blocks the main
/// thread on a synchronous IPC for up to 20 s while the page's handler runs,
/// and nothing like it exists for Copy or Cut.) So the redirect is narrowed
/// by caller and by time:
///
/// - Only a lookup of the general pasteboard's name made by WebKit's own code
///   (the nearest caller outside this module is WebCore or WebKit) gets the
///   tab's pasteboard. `NSPasteboard.general` and lookups by any other code,
///   such as the terminal, always get the system pasteboard.
///   `+[NSPasteboard generalPasteboard]` does not go through the hooked
///   lookup at all; WebKit's Copy, Cut and Paste do not use it.
/// - The redirect lasts from the start of the command until WebKit reports it
///   done or until the timeout, whichever comes first. A page that keeps the
///   command running longer (a handler that loops; dialogs from the tab are
///   answered at once by the caller) has its web content process ended at
///   the timeout, in the same main-thread turn that ends the redirect, so
///   nothing it does later reaches any pasteboard: ending the process
///   invalidates WebKit's connection to it, and WebKit drops the messages
///   that process sent but WebKit had not yet handled. Without that, a Copy
///   or Cut the page finishes late would write the system clipboard, where a
///   hostile page could plant a command for the person's next terminal paste.
///   The caller decides whether the process may be ended (it must belong only
///   to tabs a session created); when it may not, the command does not start
///   (`unavailable`), and when that changes during the command, the redirect
///   stays until WebKit reports the command done or one more timeout passes
///   (`timedOutStillRunning`), when the process is ended regardless. A
///   caller that stops waiting (its task is cancelled) changes none of this:
///   the timeout it is told about is the one that happened.
/// - A Paste's late reads would find nothing anyway: WebKit grants a Paste's
///   web process access to the general pasteboard at the command's start, by
///   the change count it sees then, which is the tab pasteboard's, and
///   refuses later reads while the general pasteboard's change count
///   differs. `perform` runs a Paste only while the tab pasteboard's count is
///   below the system's, so the system's, which only grows, never matches it.
/// - One command runs at a time in the whole app, not one per tab: WebKit's
///   lookups do not say which web view they serve, so two tabs' commands in
///   flight together would read and write each other's pasteboards. A command
///   waits up to its timeout for the one before it, then gets its own
///   timeout; it waits only while the earlier command is in flight, which is
///   at most its timeout, or two after a `timedOutStillRunning`. One that cannot
///   start in time does not run (`busy`, naming the tab it waited for), and
///   nothing is redirected for it while it waits.
///
/// - A copy another web view makes during the command (WebKit's lookups do not
///   say which web view they serve, so it gets the tab's pasteboard too) is
///   never taken as the tab's: WebKit's own Copy or Cut writes the
///   pasteboard at most once and a Paste never does (each write is one
///   change count), so a command whose pasteboard was written more often is
///   `interfered`, and the caller discards the pasteboard.
///
/// Residual risk: while a command is in flight (milliseconds, at most its
/// timeout), a person pasting in another web view of this process reads the
/// tab's pasteboard, and a copy made there fills it (and does not reach the
/// system clipboard); so does app code that WebKit calls back into (a
/// delegate) if it looks up the general pasteboard by name. Such a copy
/// reaches the tab's clipboard only when it is the one write of a Copy or
/// Cut whose page wrote nothing itself (a `copy` handler that cancels the
/// event and sets no data). The same holds after a `timedOutStillRunning`
/// until WebKit finishes, at most one more timeout. The caller test errs
/// toward WebKit: should WebKit's pasteboard code move, its lookups still
/// come from a WebKit image and stay redirected, unless it moves to
/// `+generalPasteboard`, which the WebKit tests catch as a change of the
/// system pasteboard's change count. Writes a page's own scripts make (the
/// asynchronous Clipboard API, `execCommand("copy")`) are not commands and
/// are not redirected; ``BrowserReplPageClipboard`` handles those.
