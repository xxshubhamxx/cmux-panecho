/// from the pure `String` transforms in this domain (shell-token unquoting
/// and unescaping, trailing-punctuation trimming, visible-line
/// tokenization); the resolver expands them for `~`, resolves relative
/// candidates against the surface cwd, standardizes, and probes in order.
///
/// The resolver is an instantiated value because resolution is pure only up
/// to the file system: every resolve probes candidates for existence, so the
/// file-existence capability is injected at init. Production uses the real
/// file system; tests inject a fake probe. This mirrors
/// ``TerminalLinkRouter``'s injected `BrowserHostNormalizing` seam.
