/// The cmux control-socket listener: path reservation, bind/listen lifecycle,
/// the accept source with failure backoff/rearm, the socket-path monitor, and
/// the generation-counted recovery state machine, lifted faithfully from
/// `TerminalController`.
///
/// The server owns transport state only. Everything app-shaped — telemetry,
/// client command handling, restart scheduling, notifications — crosses the
/// ``SocketControlServerEvents`` seam, and accepted client connections are
/// surfaced through ``connections``.
///
/// ## Isolation design: state separated by its drivers
///
/// The listener's state has exactly three kinds of driver, and each kind owns
/// its own data; nothing needs an isolation bridge:
///
/// - **Lifecycle mutations** (start, stop, reserve, rearm claim) are all
///   driven from the main thread — app startup, `applicationWillTerminate`,
///   the updater relaunch hook, settings-driven restarts, and the recovery
///   callbacks all live there. The full ``ListenerState`` machine, including
///   the `DispatchSource` references and their suspend flags, is therefore
///   `@MainActor`: the legacy threading, made compiler-checked. Termination
///   teardown and startup path reservation stay synchronous for their
///   callers by construction.
/// - **Hot synchronous reads** (``isRunning`` polled per client read,
///   ``activeSocketPath(preferredPath:)`` on the surface-spawn path, listener
///   health) come from arbitrary threads and must not wait on anything.
///   Every mutation publishes a ``ListenerStateSnapshot`` to a lock-guarded
///   mirror; readers pay one short uncontended lock acquire, the same cost
///   profile as the stage-2 lock core.
/// - **The accept drain and path monitor** run on the listener queue as
///   `DispatchSource` handlers (the sanctioned carve-out; there is no
///   async-native replacement short of a transport rewrite). The handlers
///   are state-free: they capture the listener descriptor and generation as
///   values, consult the published snapshot for staleness, perform syscalls,
///   and yield connections. The one piece of genuinely accept-side state —
///   the consecutive-failure streak and a one-in-flight recovery latch — is
///   a tiny lock-guarded value (``AcceptRecoveryState``), because a
///   per-accept main-thread hop to maintain a counter would be wrong and a
///   hot errno must not spin while a recovery decision hops to main.
///   Recovery *decisions* (suspend/backoff/rearm) mutate lifecycle state, so
///   they hop to the main actor, guarded against staleness by generation,
///   descriptor, and suspension checks.
///
/// Suspend/resume balance note: the suspended flag and every `suspend()`/
/// `resume()`/`cancel()` call on the sources live on the main actor, one
/// isolation domain, so the balance cannot be split by a race. The listener
/// descriptor is closed only by the accept source's cancel handler (or
/// directly when no source was ever armed), never from the main actor, so
/// the queue-side drain can never `accept(2)` on a recycled descriptor.
