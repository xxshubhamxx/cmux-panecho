/// The read-only seam through which ``ControlCommandCoordinator`` reaches live
/// app state to run control commands, without the package importing the app

///
/// It is an umbrella of one protocol per command domain so the domains can be
/// built independently (each domain owns its own seam-protocol file and its own
/// app-conformance file). The coordinator stores `any ControlCommandContext`
/// and reaches every member through this inheritance. The app target (today
/// `TerminalController`, the interim composition owner; later
/// `TerminalControlComposition`) conforms by conforming to each constituent.
///
/// `AnyObject` so the coordinator can hold the conformer `weak` and avoid a
/// retain cycle with its composition owner.
