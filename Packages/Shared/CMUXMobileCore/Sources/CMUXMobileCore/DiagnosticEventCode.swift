    // while the flag stayed true, the draft cleared at the store, or (the residual)
    // a `TextField`/`@FocusState` render blank. Logging the flag, the draft length,
    // and the composer view's appear/disappear *independently* of the flag lets a
    // single captured trace name which one happened. Raw values 11-17 are reserved
    // for the in-flight keyboard-input instrumentation branch.
