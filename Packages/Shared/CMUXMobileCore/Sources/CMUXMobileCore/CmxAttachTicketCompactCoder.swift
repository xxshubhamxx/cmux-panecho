/// Codes ``CmxAttachTicket`` to and from the compact wire form used by the
/// pairing QR payload.
///
/// The pairing QR encodes `cmux-ios://attach?v=1&payload=<base64url(JSON)>`.
/// The legacy JSON spelled out full camelCase keys plus a vestigial
/// `auth_token`, which pushed the QR into a denser version than necessary.
/// The compact grammar keeps the same envelope but encodes only what pairing
/// actually consumes: short keys, no empty optional fields, no auth token, no
/// display name (read post-handshake from `mobile.host.status`), and no
/// expiry. It does keep non-secret pairing context: the Mac account email,
/// shared pairing compatibility level, and app version/build, so the phone can
/// fail fast on an account mismatch and warn before continuing across
/// compatibility skew. A pairing QR never expires;
/// the owner's Stack access token is the
/// host's sole authorization gate (`MobileHostService.authorizationError(for:)`),
/// so ticket age authorizes nothing.
///
/// Compatibility:
/// - New decoders accept both grammars: ``CmxAttachTicketInput`` routes a
///   payload whose top-level object carries `"v"` here and everything else
///   (legacy `"version"` payloads) through the original `Codable` path.
/// - Payloads from the first compact revision still decode: their extra `e`
///   (expiry) and `n` (display name) keys are ignored, their explicit route
///   `i` ids and endpoint `t` types are honored.
/// - Old decoders reject the compact grammar loudly (a `DecodingError` from
///   the missing `"version"` key), so an outdated phone scanning a new QR
///   shows a pairing error instead of silently misreading the ticket.
///
/// Key map (ticket): `v` version, `w` workspaceID (omitted when empty),
/// `t` terminalID, `d` macDeviceID, `u` Mac account email, `pc` pairing
/// compatibility version, `av` app version, `ab` app build, `r` routes.
/// Key map (route): `i` id (omitted when the decoder can resynthesize it:
/// `kind` for the first route of a kind, `kind_N` for the Nth), `k` kind raw
/// value, `p` priority (omitted when 0), `e` endpoint.
/// Key map (endpoint): the type is implied by the keys present (accepted
/// explicitly under `t` for first-revision payloads): `h` host + `p` port, or
/// `i` peer id, or `u` url. New pairing payloads carry no Iroh path hints:
/// managed relays are app configuration, online discovery is authenticated,
/// and offline pairing resolves the scanned EndpointID locally. Decoding still
/// accepts the first compact revision's `ph`, `rh`, `da`, and `ru` fields.
