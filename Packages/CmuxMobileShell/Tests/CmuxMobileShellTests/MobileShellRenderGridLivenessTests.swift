// Regression coverage for the render-grid liveness watchdog false-fire
// (Release-sim bisect, 2026-06-10): the phone logged "render-grid stream
// silent for 10499ms, re-subscribing" every ~10.5s plus "subscribe failed
// reason=start: requestTimedOut" while the Mac demonstrably kept the
// connection healthy. Two defects combined:
//
// 1. The liveness clock was stamped only inside the listener's `for await`
//    consumer loop, which did not start until the `mobile.events.subscribe`
//    ack round-trip completed. Events yielded into the subscription stream
//    during that window were buffered invisibly, so the watchdog read a
//    healthy establishing stream as silence (and its resync then CANCELLED
//    the in-flight subscribe, which surfaces as `requestTimedOut`).
// 2. A healthy idle terminal legitimately pushes no events at all (the Mac
//    dedupes render-grid emits by row signature + stateSeq), so wall-clock
//    silence alone can never distinguish "idle" from "dead". The watchdog
//    needs a bounded host probe before it may declare death.
