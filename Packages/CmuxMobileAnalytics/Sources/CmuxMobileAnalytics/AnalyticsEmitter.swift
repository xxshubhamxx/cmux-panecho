/// The de-singletonized, non-blocking product-analytics emitter.
///
/// Constructed once at the app composition root and injected everywhere as `any
/// AnalyticsEmitting`. It buffers events off-main, merges super-properties and
/// the current identity onto each event in submission order, and flushes a batch
/// to the injected ``AnalyticsUploading`` when the buffer fills, on a cadence
/// driven by an injected `Clock`, or when the caller forces a ``flush()`` (the
/// app does this on background so events survive suspension).
///
/// ### Why an AsyncStream channel, and how it stays off the hot path
///
/// ``capture(_:_:)`` is a `nonisolated`, synchronous, non-throwing method whose
/// only work is a synchronous `continuation.yield(...)` onto an internal
/// `AsyncStream` — an `O(1)` enqueue, no `Task` spawn, no actor hop, no
/// allocation per event. A single consumer task drains the stream on the actor,
/// so event order, identity changes, and super-property updates are applied in
/// submission order. The one blocking network call lives inside the consumer's
/// `drain`, off every UI and input path. The terminal-input and render
/// fire-sites therefore call `analytics.capture(...)` with no `await`.
///
/// ### Privacy gate
///
/// ``capture(_:_:)`` consults the injected ``AnalyticsConsentProviding`` *before*
/// yielding, so when telemetry is disabled nothing is even buffered, and no
/// fire-site can bypass the opt-out. `identify` and super-property updates are
/// gated the same way.
///
/// ### Flush barrier
///
/// ``flush()`` pushes a barrier sentinel through the same FIFO and suspends until
/// the consumer reaches it, having drained everything submitted before it. That
/// makes flush deterministic (no sleeps) and lets tests assert exact upload
/// contents.

    /// `capture` keeps yielding. That window is bounded by the uploader session's
    /// `timeoutIntervalForRequest` (set short in the composition) times the fire
