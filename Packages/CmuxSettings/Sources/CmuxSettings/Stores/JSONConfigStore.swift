/// Typed read/write/observe access to settings persisted in the cmux JSON config file.
///
/// The store is an `actor`. All reads, writes, and reset are `async`, serialized
/// through actor isolation. The store only accepts ``JSONKey``; a ``DefaultsKey``
/// is rejected at compile time. There are no runtime store/key-mismatch traps.
///
/// For the rare caller that has no `await` available — e.g. a `@MainActor`
/// window-creation hook that must read a value before its first suspension point
/// — ``snapshotValue(for:)`` is a `nonisolated` synchronous read. It reads the
/// (small) config file directly rather than sharing the actor's cache, so it
/// needs no lock and always reflects what is on disk. Callers that *can* `await`
/// should use ``value(for:)``, which is backed by the in-memory cache.
///
/// JSONC (`// line` and `/* block */` comments, trailing commas) is tolerated
/// on read via the injected ``JSONCSanitizer``. Writes round-trip through
/// `JSONSerialization` with sorted, pretty-printed output; comment-preserving
/// edits are a follow-up.
///
/// Observation uses a single ``CmuxFileWatch/FileWatcher`` owned by the store
/// and fans out file-change events to per-subscriber `AsyncStream<Void>`
/// signals. One file event causes exactly one cache invalidation and one
/// notification per active subscriber, regardless of how many keys are being
/// observed. Each subscriber dedups on its own typed value so only real
/// changes propagate.

/// try await store.set("hunter2", for: catalog.automationSocketPassword)
