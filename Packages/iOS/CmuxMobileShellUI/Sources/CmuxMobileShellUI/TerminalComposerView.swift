/// A growing multi-line text field with the send button INSIDE its rounded
/// container (trailing edge, riding the last line as the field grows — exactly
/// iMessage's circular up-arrow), rendered with Liquid Glass (iOS 26+, with a
/// thin-material fallback). Send delivers the text as a bracketed paste followed
/// by a single Return (via `terminal.paste`), so a multi-line message lands as
/// one submission instead of fragmenting on every interior newline.
///
/// Open by default per terminal (like iMessage's always-present input bar), and
/// presented does NOT mean focused: the field appears with the keyboard down and
/// takes focus only on a user tap or an explicit focus request from the store
/// (an explicit open/reveal, or a terminal switch mid-compose). The button to
/// the left of the field opens the photo picker for image attachments; the
/// composer is dismissed from the accessory toolbar's compose toggle.
///
/// The bottom dock (terminal grid / composer band / accessory toolbar / keyboard)
/// is owned entirely by `GhosttySurfaceView` in one coordinate system. This view is
/// hosted in a `UIHostingController` that `GhosttySurfaceRepresentable` installs into
/// the surface's composer band, directly above the always-visible accessory toolbar.
/// The view reports its measured height through ``onHeightChange`` so the surface can
/// reserve exactly that much above the toolbar; a field-grow therefore pushes ONLY the
/// terminal up while the toolbar and keyboard below stay put. There is no
