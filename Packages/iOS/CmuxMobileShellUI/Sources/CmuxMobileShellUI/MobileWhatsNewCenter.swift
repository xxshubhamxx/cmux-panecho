/// acknowledgement state.
///
/// Visibility policy (user-approved): the remote list is truth; the last
/// fetched list is cached on device and wins while offline; a device that
/// has NEVER fetched the list shows the binary entries (fail-open to binary
/// truth, because remote hiding is the exceptional operation). During a
/// rollout, a nonempty list containing only retired ids is treated as stale
/// and falls back to current native entries; an explicit empty list still
/// hides binary pages.
///
/// Acknowledgement: binary pages advance a single "newest acknowledged entry
/// id" marker over the ordered catalog, so a user who skipped several
/// releases gets one sheet covering every unseen page. Announcements have no
/// stable order relative to the catalog (they arrive and expire remotely),
/// so they acknowledge into an id set.
