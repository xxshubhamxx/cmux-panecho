/// A seam over `UNUserNotificationCenter` so ``MobileShellComposite`` can react
/// to Mac-side `notification.dismissed` / `notification.badge` events and run
/// the foreground reconcile without hardcoding the

/// ``SystemDeliveredNotificationClearer``; tests inject a fake to assert which
/// ids were cleared and which badge counts were applied.
///
/// All ids at this seam are STABLE MAC-SIDE NOTIFICATION IDS (the
/// `cmux.notificationId` payload key the Mac stamps on every forwarded
/// banner), never raw `UNNotificationRequest` identifiers: a delivered remote
/// notification's request identifier equals the `apns-collapse-id` only by
/// observed OS behavior, not by documented contract, so conformers map between
/// the two themselves (see
/// ``SystemDeliveredNotificationClearer/macNotificationID(for:)``).
