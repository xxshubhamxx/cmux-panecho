// Consumes `mobile.sync.delta` events and the `mobile.sync.fetch` cursor RPC,
// mirrors the Mac's workspace/group records locally, and projects the mirror
// into the exact `MobileSyncWorkspaceListResponse` shape the legacy full-list
// path applies, so everything downstream of `applyRemoteWorkspaceList` (per-Mac
// state, group collapse, selection sync) is shared, not duplicated. A Mac that
// does not implement `mobile.sync.fetch` answers `method_not_found` and this
// connection silently stays on the legacy refetch loop.
