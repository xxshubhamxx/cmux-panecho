/// Regression coverage for how the pending-delete outbox REPLAYS a tombstone.
///
/// A forget writes its tombstone (`addPendingDelete`) under a scope key that
/// pins the exact (account, team) of the deleted row, then deletes the local
/// row, then uploads the backup delete. If that upload fails (or the app dies),
/// the next read replays the tombstone. The replay's only job is to finish and
/// confirm THAT exact deletion; it must never broaden. Replaying through the
/// broad `remove` re-resolves visibility (``TeamScopedPairedMacStore`` looks the
/// device up under the scope's team, which also returns team-less legacy rows),
/// so in the common failed-upload case — where the exact row is ALREADY deleted
/// locally — the replay resolves a SURVIVING unrelated alias of the same device
/// and deletes it. Exact-scope replay is a no-op on the already-deleted row.
