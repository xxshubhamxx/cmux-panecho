/// UIKit root that owns terminal clipping, dock placement, and keyboard motion.

/// Dock seat: `UIKeyboardLayoutGuide` wherever it is trustworthy (chrome
/// visible, non-iOS-27). iOS keyboards animate with a private spring that
/// notification-driven followers can only approximate — dogfood consistently
/// rated the guide-seated composer bar as "stuck to the keyboard the whole
/// way" while the notification approximation reads duller — so the bar rides
/// UIKit's own keyboard transaction, pixel-locked. On iOS 27 (where the
/// guide can lie at the screen bottom) and while the chrome is hidden (the
/// guide's safe-area fallback cannot seat an invisible dock flush with the
/// screen edge), the seat falls back to the notification-driven constant
/// from the keyboard-pinning rebuild (#10518). On iOS ≤26 that fallback
/// consumes the full notification stream (`keyboardDidChangeFrame`
/// disagreement reseats, steady-state tracker heals). The iOS 27 seat
/// trusts ONLY `keyboardWillChangeFrame` payloads and rebases interrupted
/// legs from live presentation frames: that OS misreports keyboard frames
/// outside the will transaction, so a did-frame reseat or a steady-state
/// re-derivation moves a perfectly settled dock (#9958/#10006 shipped the
/// will-only contract; #10518 recorded the misreporting when it quarantined
/// the rebuilt path away from iOS 27). ``MobileKeyboardFrameTracker`` heals
/// the keyboard MODEL (height and visibility, for the toolbar toggle and
/// diagnostics) after transitions missed while detached, on every OS.
///
/// Terminal presentation: the grid never resizes for the keyboard (see
/// `TerminalLetterboxGeometry.terminalContainerSize`); the full-height
/// render pins through STATIC inequalities —
///
///     renderWrapper.bottom <= host.bottom                    (natural cap)
///     renderWrapper.bottom <= dock.top + chrome + blank      (content cap)
///     renderWrapper.bottom == host.bottom   (optional pull, priority 750)
///
/// so the solver keeps the wrapper as low as the caps allow: while the
/// content bottom fits above the composer bar the natural cap binds (the
/// keyboard covers only blank rows) and while it does not, the content cap
/// binds and the render rides the dock. NOTHING retargets during a keyboard
/// leg — the caps are keyboard-independent, so the wrapper's target comes
/// out of the SAME layout solve and animation transaction that moves the
/// dock, whichever authority is seating it. `chrome` and `blank` change only
/// on chrome mutations and content measurements. There is no settle-fold and
/// no presentation rebasing: with no grid renegotiation there is nothing to
/// mask. While the chrome is visible the grid container additionally
/// reserves `TerminalLetterboxGeometry.dockSeamPadding`, so the render's
/// bottom edge rides that many points ABOVE the dock top instead of flush
/// against the toolbar — the seam lives in the grid, not in these
/// constraints, so the cap arithmetic above is unchanged.
