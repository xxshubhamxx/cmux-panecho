/// opacity tracks ``leadingEdgeAlpha(contentOffsetX:fadeWidth:)``: invisible
/// at rest (the first key renders fully), strengthening with the first points
/// of scroll, and a full transparent→opaque ramp once scrolled past a band
/// width. Buttons therefore dissolve under the composer button instead of
/// hard-clipping, which also signals that scrolled-away keys exist to the
/// left (HIG scroll-view guidance: imply continuation past the edge).

/// `contentOffset` change, so no scroll-view delegate is consumed; the

/// stay glued to the visible viewport rather than scrolling with the content.
