/// Owns the `AVAudioEngine` + shared `AVAudioSession` lifecycle OFF the main
/// actor for ``ComposerDictationController``.
///
/// `AVAudioSession.setActive(_:)`, `AVAudioEngine.start()`, and their stop
/// counterparts are synchronous audio-hardware calls that block their caller
/// roughly 100-300ms each. ``ComposerDictationController`` is `@MainActor`, so
/// running them inline froze the composer mic button's press animation on every
/// toggle (https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues/6284). This owner runs
/// every one of those calls on its own serial queue, so the main actor only ever
/// ENQUEUES the work — it never blocks on the audio hardware.
///
/// Concurrency: a private serial `DispatchQueue` plus `@unchecked Sendable`, NOT
/// an `actor` — a deliberate low-level carve-out (lint:allow serial-audio-queue),
/// matching the established AVFoundation-session-on-a-serial-queue pattern already
/// used for capture in `QRCodeCaptureController` (Apple's own AVFoundation sample
/// code drives capture/audio sessions from a dedicated serial dispatch queue, not
/// Swift concurrency). Two concrete reasons an actor is the wrong tool here:
///   1. `setActive`/`engine.start`/`engine.stop` are SYNCHRONOUS, ~100-300ms
///      blocking hardware calls. On an actor they would block a cooperative-pool
///      thread (the pool is sized to the core count), risking starvation/priority
///      inversion across the app; a dedicated serial queue confines the block to
///      its own thread.
///   2. The supersession invariant needs ``stop()`` enqueued SYNCHRONOUSLY and in
///      deterministic FIFO order relative to ``start(tapBlock:onReady:)``, directly
///      from the `@MainActor` controller's synchronous teardown path. A serial
///      `DispatchQueue.async` guarantees that; a cross-actor `await` (which the
///      synchronous controller could only reach via `Task { await … }`) gives no
///      deterministic ordering between independently-scheduled tasks.
/// The mutable state (`engine`, `isActive`) is touched ONLY on ``queue`` — every
/// entry point hops through it, and ``teardownLocked()`` asserts the invariant with
/// `dispatchPrecondition` — so the type is data-race-free despite wrapping the
/// non-Sendable `AVAudioEngine`. Callers pass `@Sendable` closures and hop back to
/// the main actor inside them, exactly like the controller's authorization and
/// recognition callbacks. Because ``queue`` is serial and FIFO, a ``stop()``
/// enqueued while a ``start(tapBlock:onReady:)`` is mid-flight is always ordered
/// AFTER that start's activation and BEFORE any later start's activation, so the
/// engine can never be double-started or leak a tap across a rapid stop/restart.
