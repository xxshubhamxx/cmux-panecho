/// ``MobileBuildType/internal`` builds and hidden from ``MobileBuildType/prod``
/// (the official App Store app) and ``MobileBuildType/demo``. Public channels
/// see an entry only when it EXPLICITLY lists their token, which the remote
/// catalog can do per entry (`entryChannels` / announcement `channels` in
/// `/api/whats-new`) to opt a specific page into the official app later.
