// Storage-bound sync orchestration for the TeamPresence DO.
//
// This is the half of the sync layer that touches Durable Object storage. It is
// written against a minimal `SyncStorage` interface (the subset of
// `DurableObjectStorage` it needs) so it unit-tests against a Map-backed fake
// without the Workers runtime — the same testability posture as core.ts/sync.ts.
//
// Responsibilities (DESIGN.md §5):
//   - Own the per-collection key space inside the DO's storage, additive to the
//     existing presence keys (`inst:`/`owner:`/`meta:`), never touching them:
//       synced:<collection>:<id>   -> StoredSyncRecord (the authoritative record)
//       synchead:<collection>      -> number (the per-collection rev clock)
//       synctomb:<collection>:<rev>-> id (rev-ordered tombstone index for GC)
//       syncgcfloor:<collection>   -> number (highest GC'd tombstone rev)
//   - Mint a new rev ONLY when a record's list-shape actually changes, so a
//     steady-state heartbeat (`seen` tick / online↔offline flip) does not churn
//     the cursor (DESIGN.md §5.2). The caller passes already-derived records;
//     this layer decides write-or-skip by comparing the stored payload.
//   - Build rev-filtered snapshots (records with rev <= snapshotRev) and deltas
//     (records with rev > cursor) and decide snapshot-vs-delta from the GC floor.
//   - GC tombstones past the retention window and raise the GC floor.
//   - Lazily upgrade stored records whose schemaVersion is below current.
//
// Every key read uses `?? default` so this code runs correctly against an old
// DO instance that has never written a sync key (the additive-rollout property
// in DESIGN.md §5.4). It never assumes a sync key exists.
