// TeamPresence Durable Object — one instance per team (idFromName(teamId)).
//
// Holds the team's ephemeral presence map in DO storage and fans transitions
// out to subscribers. Offline is an explicit event produced by the DO alarm
// when an instance misses heartbeats (see core.ts for the cadence rationale),
// never something clients infer from staleness.
//
// Subscribers come in two transports sharing one broadcast path:
//   - WebSocket (primary, hibernation API: idle teams cost nothing)
//   - SSE (curl-friendly; keeps the DO pinned while connected, acceptable for
//     the small per-team subscriber counts presence has)
//
// Authorization happens in the worker before anything reaches this object; the
// DO trusts its caller. Isolation is by construction: the worker derives the
// DO id from the verified team id, so one team's object can never be reached
// with another team's credentials.
